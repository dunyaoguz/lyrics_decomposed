He was going out of town just to put it on stage Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get paid Slept in the car, clothes in the back seat Twenty dollars to get them hoes in the back seat Got tired of that, then he set some goals Hoping this rap shit'll get him some gold Oh, never thinking of what he 'bout to be Then six years later, everybody copy me, ya see me?
