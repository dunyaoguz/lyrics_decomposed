Man, I been everywhere. Everyday trying to get a better understanding of myself and this crazy game I have given my life to What I’ve come to grips with is the fact that I am not superhuman, BUT super human.  I think our culture has made it almost a prerequisite to be “too cool” or “swagged out” carrying a “nothing can phase me” image. It’s to the point that the ones who show they care, get attacked the most. Who ever thought we’d see a day when somebody used the word “poetic” as an insult? I certainly never thought that.  “I can’t fuck wit Wale ‘ol poetic ass.” Really? These are the same people who probably have every Pac album embedded in their head. But, I digress. I took an absence from Twitter because I started to care tooooo much. I still don’t know the root of what makes me care THAT much, but I’m quite sure it started by wanting to lead people in a direction that wasn’t as cliché as some of my peers I’m no saint. I fuck with ratchet bitches. I say bitch. I bitch about things my damn self. But, I can honestly say, that I try to use my “human” traits as a means of relating to other humans.  If I can bare my insecurities and flaws before you, maybe you won’t feel so insecure and flawed There came a point where people went out of their way to remind me that I’m missin my mark. Albeit, I made myself a target to slander and criticism. I think it became a trend to fuck with anybody that cared about people’s opinion. I’m not one of those people who make music for material things. I strive to make music for a public that appreciates raw emotion. And I will continue to I went through stages of frustration in my career with publications because of my own selfishness and sense of entitlement. I admit that. Nevertheless, I think if we calling a spade a spade, some media outlets be on they bullshit with me for reasons outside of music. But, my goal moving forward is to focus less on THEM and more on US.  We all have goals and mine is simple. Empower the people. Empower MY fans and focus on MY fans and their energy . I don’t think it’s humanly possible for me to appease some of these outlets no matter what I create. It burns my soul to hear there’s no message tho. So knowin that I may have fell short of connecting with some of them,  I’ve decided to use my energy on US. The guy with all the mixtapes. The guy who listens to every song twice because they know there’s things hidden in there. The girl who can’t wait to hear “Ambitious Girl 3” (Oh, it’s coming). The girl with the “Ambition” tattoo, who gets dressed to “Illest Bitch Alive” every morning . The ones who understood my frustration, hated my rant but understood it nevertheless . I may never be the biggest rapper in the world (still one of the best doe) but, I’ll be the most dedicated to my fans and it starts with this right here. This is rare. This is REAL. This is about us. This is about the music again. My ReRE -Dedication to greatness. What we got doesn’t happen often, nor with too many people.

I love you then I hate you Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too I made room for this love. How foolish of me And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect But you was low on love, what I do; reimbursed it And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya And what’s worse is before this, I had worshiped you Now war missiles hand guns and grenades The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank Now momma told me be careful who you love G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up You spend your time with your friends all the time And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline My minds gone evil. You changed with the season You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima  So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin' I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again  Why we gotta argue Why we gotta fight I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for So tell me why are we at war    Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want And nobody else can stop it I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile  The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up They call me better now. See when everything is stopped And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again Cause in the end its not about what you put in Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it If a period is late then I will mark it with a question That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas The war  Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for So tell me why are we at war?  Just another product of this matrix This maze I'm in amazes me at times I just wanted to be at peace with you And if I gotta settle for a piece of you Then I gotta say peace to you With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect Effort is all I ask If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more And if that means that I'm askin for too much I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past We bash We blast We shoot We lose We pass.....war",0.9647,23,15,12,27,27,39,35,16,10,15
