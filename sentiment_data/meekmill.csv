locking us in a cell with a stranger for them to raise us and wonder why we rebellious Niggas going through pain I was missing from school cause I was going through things Now I'm getting this money feel like I'm going through change Niggas driving me crazy they threw it all for the fame   Money ain't the root of all evil its attention now Knocking down schools in my city to bring a prison 'round They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city They killed Lil Snupe in his own city Wonder why I don't be in my own city I don't know if niggas gone clap for me or going to kill me Still living lavish and

arrogant, that money was staggering They locked me PC with them trannies and rat, man that shit was embarrassing Twenty three hours in the cell by myself, man you couldn't imagine it They fed me some shit I wouldn't feed to my dog, man that shit was the nastiest Can you imagine me losing my mind Doing push ups 52 at a time Do the whole deck just to get through the time Just to get back to my son and get back to my mom Cause Papi keep asking me where am I at I told him in jail and I said I'll be back He said when you back can you get me from school Shit like that there turn boy to a goon On to the graveyard its only one stop We live fast die from gun shots And in this lifestyle we sling dope, bust Glocks Why you think we say fuck cops Cause when they lock us up all the fun stop And when the ice cream truck come it wouldn't stop So for them little babies all the fun stops They turn to goons and we post on the corner like a bus stop Waiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock They put shackles on us like jewelry we say fuck rocks Cause all we ever wanted was to sell blocks To get a little real estate to sell blocks Until we got a little taste of cell blocks And try to turn to God when these cells lock Have mercy on me touch down catch a case trying to sell rock And we didn't want to believe that Hell's hot My mom told me you might as well stop Cause you can't ride your weight when the wells drop And your waters off and your bills due And your shit stank smell like mildew Cause you got wet all up and left there cause them little niggas done killed you   In the kitchen like grandma Put these bitches on stand by When it come to getting this money fuck everything no playing time If you real nigga you can't mind Real niggas we can't die Christian Loubs on their period cause
