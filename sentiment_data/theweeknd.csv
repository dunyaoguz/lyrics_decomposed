No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy  Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The 'Rolling Stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence pieces of clothing off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist  This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 'Trilogy'. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint  Sincerely Abel Tesfaye XO",0.9802,5,13,3,5,8,10,23,7,6,13

Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane   Beaming through your door I see right through your faults Eyes tryna feed me more lies Girl I’m on top, of all your little side plans All your little side mans All in for your waist and I must have been out my mind   Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause   I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake Give or take, couple days Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane  I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying find out if your heart breaks Can it break? Is it fake? Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane   Running through them boys You play me like a toy And 'bout to here that noise When I find out your thoughts girl Sweating on the outside shaking on the inside Girl I’m reading your mind And it's filled with lies   Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause   I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake Give or take, couple days Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane  I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying find out if your heart breaks Can it break? Is it fake? Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane   Girl you're out of love Girl you know you're out of love so Pack up all your stuff Girl you had your chance But this time, this time was your last   I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake Give or take, couple days Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane  I’m looking through you like an x-ray I’m trying find out if your heart breaks Can it break? Is it fake? Should I wait? Am I late? Thinking hard, got me going insane",-0.9763,12,13,5,10,7,37,9,12,7,1
