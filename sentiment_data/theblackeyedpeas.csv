Donde esta el amor Yo, people living like they ain’t got no mama Donde esta el amor I think they all distracted by the drama, attracted to the trauma, mama Donde esta el amor I think they don’t understand the concept or the meaning of karma Donde esta el amor...  Por un mundo sin violencia Donde no hay dolor (Donde esta el amor) Donde no existe el odio Solo el amor (Donde esta el amor) Dios hoy en día me pregunto  Amor, Amor Donde esta el amor x3 (donde esta el amor)  And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate, then you’re bound to get irate Man this is what you demonstrate And that’s exactly how hate works and operates  Man, we gotta set it straight Take control of your mind, just meditate And let your soul just gravitate To the love so the whole world celebrate it  Tu y yo somos iguales Invencibles e incansables Una union sin geografia Que se entrega sin mirar a quien  Existimos sin murallas Compartiendo el mismo sol Cumpliendo el sueño que nos trajo aquí (Donde esta el amor)  It just ain’t the same, old ways have changed New days are strange, just the world insane?

(Yo no, yo no, se) Y la verdad, yo… I don’t know  Tu y yo somos iguales Invencibles e incansables Una union sin geografia Que se entrega sin mirar a quien  Existimos sin murallas Compartiendo el mismo sol Cumpliendo el sueño que nos trajo aquí   Donde esta? Lo busco en la sociedad El amor hace el prójimo Y el respeto y la piedad Porque el resentimiento Nunca encubre la verdad Que aquí y en todo el mundo solo dios puede juzgar  Donde esta el amor? Esta en nuestro corazón Lo podras sentir Si haces una buena acción Nuestra civilization Necesita un cambio profundo Te invito a que seas el cambio Que quieres ver en el mundo  Donde esta el amor? x8  Donde esta el amor!?

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder Most of us only care about money makin' Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction  Wrong information always shown by the media Negative images is the main criteria Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema  What happened to the love and the values of humanity (Donde esta el amor?) What happened to the love and the fairness and equality (Where’s the love?) Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity (Donde esta el amor?)
