We'll say: no man But you can do the job When you're in town Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland   In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is circus clown We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman Until the other kids knock him down   When it snows, ain't it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland   Sleigh bells ring, are you listening In the lane, snow is glistening A beautiful sight We're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland Walking in a winter wonderland Walking in a winter wonderland Walking in a winter wonderland",0.9683,0,7,1,2,10,3,15,0,2,2
