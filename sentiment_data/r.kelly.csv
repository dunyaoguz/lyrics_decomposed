Well, let's do this Before this all gets out of hand Just talk about your main concerns And what bothers you about this relationship the most Cathy, you go first And Rufus, listen and try to understand    Cathy starts telling the doc, how, in the beginning, everything was fine Then, outta nowhere, she starts crying and screaming, and putting everything out on the line    And everything he told me (Sobbing) I mean, everything I believed And I just don't understand, doc, how he could want another man over me, oh!    How do you feel about that, Rufus?    Rufus?    When I first met Cathy, it was just like... meeting Heaven I had just finished school, and became a reverend And everything I needed, she provided...    What happened, Rufus?!    But then I met Chuck, and somehow got misguided!    Oh!    So you went off the road that you were meant to travel?    Yes, I did!    Despite the fact you knew every word in the Bible, Rufus!    (To Perry) I'm sorry!    Don't look at me, look at Cathy!    (To Cathy) I'm sorry!    You really went and screwed things up, Rufus!    Cathy, please! I'm sorry!    So, tell me this!

And then I look in my rear view I cannot believe this (Whoo whoo whoo) Damn, here comes a policeman He drove right up on me and flashed his lights Then I pulled over without thinking twice He hops out the car and walked over to me And said, ""License and registration please."" I looked up at him and said ""Officer, is there something wrong?"" He said, ""No, except you were doin 85 in a 60 mile zone"" Then I said, ""Officer Let me explain please You see the truth of the matter is Is that I got an emergency."" He said, ""No excuses and no exception."" I said, ""This is some bullshit."", as he gave me the ticket Said, ""Have a nice day."", and walked away I said, ""Yeah right."", and drove away Then I turned my radio on And did 70 all the way home I pulled up in the driveway Hopped out and slammed the car door Then go in through the back Bust up in the house Pull back the shower door And she screaming, ""What's all that for?""

I said, ""I love you."" And she said, ""I love you, too."" Then a tear fell up out my eye And then I called her my sunshine And then she looked at me And said, ""Baby go deeper please."" And that's when I start goin' crazy Like I was tryin' to give her a baby The room feel like it's spinning Cause we keep turning and turning As if we were in a whirlwind The way our toes are curling The next thing ya know, she starts going real wild And starts screaming my name Then I said, ""Baby, we must slow down Before I bust a vessel in my brain."" And she said, ""Please no don't stop."" And I said, ""I caught a cramp."" Then she said, ""Please keep on going."" I said, ""My leg is about to crack."" Then she cries out ""Oh my goodness, I'm about to climax."" And I said, ""Cool, climax Just let go of my leg!"" She says, ""You're the perfect lover."" I said, ""I can't go no further.""
