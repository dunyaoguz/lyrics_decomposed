You fuck with my emotions I try leaving you, but every time I do You'll go and buy me roses   Blue isn't my color But you painted me so carefully My strength was too much for you And I allowed you to make me so weak   But I know you better than you You're coming home with an excuse Giving me gifts, hiding the truth But I see through it all   And I'll pray that all of the flowers stop growing So you'll find another way of showing me your love And I'll wait for the sky to change colour Rivers stop running Maybe then you'll change your love Maybe then you'll change your love   Who's the bigger fool? Is it me or is it you? You fuck with my emotions I try leaving you, but every time I do You'll go and buy me roses Maybe then you'll change your love   This one's on me The cycle repeats, baby This one's on me This one's on me The cycle repeats, baby This one's on me This one's on me The cycle repeats, baby This one's on me This one's on me The cycle repeats, baby This one's for me   And I'll pray that all of the flowers stop growing So you'll find another way of showing me your love And I'll wait for the sky to change colour Rivers stop running Maybe then you'll change your love Maybe then you'll change your love   Who's the bigger fool? Is it me or is it you? You fuck with my emotions Maybe then you'll change your love I try leaving you, but every time I do You'll go and buy me roses Maybe then you'll change your love   I'll pray that all of the flowers stop growing So you'll find another way of showing me your love",0.9975,0,14,3,18,23,8,35,1,6,7
