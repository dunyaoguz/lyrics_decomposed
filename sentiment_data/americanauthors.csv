If you think the universe is so big and vast Don't wanna be alone You moved on too fast Didn't catch his name Just trying to catch my breath   Of course it's you I'd seen them walking down the street Maybe the world is telling me it's never easy   So listen up My heart is dark I know that I've been replaced I've had enough I've tried to love Keep coming back to this place I wanna be free and let you fly away To see your smile Upon you face It's the hardest part of being replaced   I heard you moved in Wasn't that our plan? Still wake up in the morning And I reach for your hand I failed chemistry, I don't understand   Most days I sleep in See more night than day I had all the answers now the questions have changed It's a running joke that I can't escape   So listen up My heart is dark I know that I've been replaced I've had enough I've tried to love Keep coming back to this place I wanna be free and let you fly away To see your smile Upon you face It's the hardest part of being replaced   It's never easy It's never easy   Of course it's you I'd seen them walking down the street Maybe the world is telling me it's never easy   So listen up My heart is dark I know that I've been replaced I've had enough I've tried to love Keep coming back to this place I wanna be free and let you fly away To see your smile Upon you face It's the hardest part of being replaced",0.9659,1,6,1,2,6,4,10,4,5,5
