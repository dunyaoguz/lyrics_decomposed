I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind, maybe  The fruits of love grow all around But for me they come a tumblin' down Every day heartaches grow a little stronger I can't stand this pain much longer  I walk in shadows, searching for light Cold and alone, no comfort in sight Hoping and praying for someone to care Always moving and going nowhere  What becomes of the broken hearted ? Who had love that's now departed ? I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind, maybe  I'm searching though I don't succeed But someone look, there's a growing need Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning All that's left is an unhappy ending  Now what's become of the broken-hearted ? Who had love that's now departed ? I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind I'll be searching everywhere just to find someone to care I'll be looking everyday, I know I'm gonna find a way Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'll find a way somehow I'll be searching everywhere ...",0.9712,6,9,1,6,16,15,19,12,2,12
