Targets on the rifle range Who makes the call and who gets to choose? Who gets to win and who gets to lose? It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues And blues never fade away Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls But blues never fade away   He shone so bright with a lust for life Like the sun king that he was His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth And for reasons i never understood About the choices made between the bad and good I've tried to figure out but The pain never goes away   And there's marble markers and little white crosses Along the beaten path And I've spread their ashes on the wind And I miss John Lennon's laugh  ,0.9824,7,7,4,6,8,19,16,11,5,9

I hated the sod - for thirty-three year We should never have married of that I'm quite clear He spent the housekeeping money on whiskey and beer And never lifted a finger Times were hard, but the swine rolled back pissed So we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed So I'd clobber the sod when he couldn't resist: Asleep, you can't lift a finger  But we'd go dancing And he'd hold me tight He was air, He was water, He was breath, He was light And he would hold me there, with all his might And it was bliss for an hour or so But then they called time to go And in the morning we were sober  O he'd drink and he'd talk just like a fool Lie like a bairn and snore like a mule Rarely was sober, pretty much was the rule And he never lifted a finger I suppose times were hard, things were different then Women were women and men, they were men Seventeen, that was it, your life ended when you had a ring around your finger  But we'd go dancing, he was me own Brando And for a moment there my heart was a-glow We had dust in our hair and nowhere to go Boo we were free for an hour or three From the people we had to be But in the morning we were sober  But if I went through my time again Oh I'd do it without the help of men Or at least your Grandad But then again, you know Best not to linger  What is the use of dreaming now? I had my chance, well anyhow If I'd only known then what I know now I'd've given them all the finger  And gone dancing, and not give a shit And spin around and reel and love each bit And I'd dance alone and enjoy it And I'd be me for an entire life Instead of somebody's wife And I never would be sober And I never would be sober",0.9798,5,9,5,2,8,12,10,2,2,7
