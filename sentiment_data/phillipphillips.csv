I was yours Only to act out a game that I did not know  Who am I, who are you. What are we anymore? Just a darkness in my life or like a whole in the floor Won’t you take it all away and I’ll take mine to the lord The angels may fall but never close enough to let me soar  Eagles are flying and crows are dying I guess I’ll jump quick Just to see if I still have a chance to live I played around and around I went but a circle grows old I guess I’m just another square in this circled world that we call home  Who am I, who are you. What are we anymore? Just a darkness in my life or like a hole in the floor Won’t you take it all away and I’ll take mine to the lord The angels may fall but never close enough to let me soar",0.3781,4,3,3,5,4,10,7,7,6,6

It’s all such mystery  Wanted is love Not going insane You know you’ve got to hold onto what you love before it’s gone away  Wanted is love Not going insane You know you’ve got to seek everything you love before it’s gone away  Wanted is love Not going insane You know you’ve got to seek everything you lost before",0.9945,7,6,3,6,11,9,15,4,5,7
