I'd just be rising to fall  Love was easy to believe in When you wanted me yesterday But I couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow  After you What am I gonna be? You took a part of me As you were passing through  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  Drifting again From place to place without reason Season to season I just keep running away  And as for people again I'm just a girl who discovers Now and then lovers Who never ask me to stay  Love was easy to believe in When I walked in the light of you Now I'm walking by myself And all I see is darkness  After you What am I gonna be? You took a part of me As you were passing through  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  Raining again I ought to get out from under Sometimes I wonder Sometimes I don't wonder at all  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  After you What am I gonna be You took a part of me As you were passing through  Raining again Raining again Raining again  After you What am I gonna be Raining again,0.9806,1,4,0,1,5,2,9,2,0,4

One more chance Isn't that what we're fighting for? Why throw away a love That needs one more chance  Now I'm afraid that after all I've said You'll still turn me down And you'll smile And say I'll see you around  But remember that You still have a choice And I hope and pray you'll make it  You'll think of my heart And you won't wanna break it And I'll prove to you The kind of lady I can be  Give me just one more chance Such a simple thing I'm asking for Just one more chance It would be a shame to close the door to  One more chance Isn't that what we pray each night for? One more chance Isn't that what we're fighting for?
