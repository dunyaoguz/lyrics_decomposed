Days like these don't come up any higher We've got main street lit up like a fire Nothing compares to breathing the air When I'm back in my hometown Someday my kids will run like I did On these streets and old playgrounds!  I wanna drive all night Turn up the radio loud Love's hanging in the breeze I shut the whole world out So come and ride with me baby I'm saving you the front seat baby Feeling nothing but free baby On these American nights!
