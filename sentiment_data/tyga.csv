And what you were, when you were next to me Seemed matching on someone touchable Feelable for me What you were on my sight Was like a mirror I could see me through Your eyes could beat in your vibe  We played I know we messed it up, chosen the worst game to play on Both with fear of nothing More than the way feelin can make you get weak Dont know if I believed you were too weak for me To let it hurt, make me ever unhappy Or if I thought you were more Someone any pain I would be willin to pay for  But in the end, we messed it up The gain was nothin our debts been love And seems now my hearts stagnatin, always on repeat Not knowin the rhythm havin lost its beat My mind always with the same words Move on move on move one Your strong But its wrong Ive chosena be weak Chosena feel Now I feel strong only if you was with me Yet not weak enough to stay Yet too proud to cut it, interrupt it Stop to make it go on, make it play  I thought it was all fun And id never be jelous of you Thought we were just playin It was nothin real, nothin true  But now. I can't touch you anymore Your scent could make me cry Was that what you were lookin for..? I ain't ask you, ainta say tell me why  Cuz we always played From the very beginning I started, sure that id be the part winning And you know that.i would have I had the choice But I listened to my innerselfe'voice Felt like 'give it a try' felt like 'it could be special' Like 'Youre special in your way The opposite within the same.'
