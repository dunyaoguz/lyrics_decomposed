Whatever happened to keeping it real? Back in the day when you was rapping, before the time of your deal And now you got signed, well, it's all clear and it's simple You're only making music that you pretend that you're into Come on dance with you was never a hit fool And what the hell is taking you so long with your next single? (Fix up) Fix up? It's been about six months And insults are everywhere Even your own fans think your shit sucks (I don't like Jay Sean) And I know you pretend to ignore it It's gotta hurt when you're even getting dissed on your own forum Yeah, I've done my research back when you started for Back when people thought you was the genuine article Genuine my ass, you're just a wack imitation The only thing different about you is the fact that you're Asian Well, I guess it must've helped a bit The fact that everything that has an Asian twist Including music, I guess we're calling it I'm surprised that Simon Cowell hasn't thought of it And there's issues that I find myself being faced with Being pigeon holed and accused of imitating It's a struggle and it's so frustrating Telling me I'm tryna be the Asian Craig David And I bet that just had you in tears Wasn't that the reason you ended up shaving your beard? I guess you couldn't take the way people would mock that So it was off with the jaw line and goodbye to the sock hat But you still a bit of style with the fastest singing On verse two of 'Dance with you' Now you wonder why they couldn't slander you Well, you say you done your research, baby You didn't look hard enough, it needs updating If you think that I'm copying Craig Listen to my 1994 demo tape I was fast rapping and singing back in the day Back in the fush niggas and Big L phase Whatever, it seems you sold your soul to the game You're a fake 'cause Jay Sean ain't even your name So how'd you come up with that? It ain't unique after all What are you? Like a cross between Jay-Z and Sean Paul? You're better off with the name you was born You little pansy you really should have been called gay porn So which one's your lover? Rishi Rich or Juggy D? Probably Rishi, he sees you as his bitch, doesn't he? Wasn't he the one responsible for launching your career? Like a while ago, I'm talking like well over a year You were studying medicine then, but you quit that now To do music, how the hell did you manage to flip that 'round? And how'd you tell your parents You know how shit that sounds ""Mummy Daddy, I want to be a pop star"" ""Sit back down"" But never the less, I quit, went ahead and progressed Had my eyes on my goal and wouldn't settle for less What do you mean? You only got where you are 'cause of a gimmick The whole Indian thing was big and you were luckily in it And don't be upset if people don't come to your shows They're not allowed out 'cause half of your fans are eleven year olds (Jay Sean) Wow, big deal you got to number 12 I'm not surprised If your mum brought half of the copies herself You know what I'm tired man, I'm sick, I'm bored of you Run off, you little puppet, I hear Rishi Rich calling you I guess you talk the talk but you were rapping for years And it was me who got your foot in the door It seems that your ego has been suffering blows 'Cause you only get heard when you guest appear on my shows I'm not phased, if it wasn't for me You wouldn't be on this track in the first place",0.6941,18,14,12,9,20,32,38,13,13,22
