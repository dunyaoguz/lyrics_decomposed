Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa   Mañana que amanezca un día nuevo en mi universo Mañana no veré tu nombre escrito entre mis versos No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento Mañana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante Mañana ni siquiera habrá razones para odiarte Yo borrare todos tus sueños de mis sueños Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos   Qué Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba Como permiso para así romperme el alma   Qué Hiciste?
