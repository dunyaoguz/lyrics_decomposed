Swept off my feet, said, ""God save me now"" How many people dance in a dark room? Swept off my feet, said, ""God save me now"" Is it real love? Is it real love? Ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb I can feel your, I can feel your heart Ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb   Heads up, look alive The more that I stare into your eyes The more I get lost in your face; I'm warning you, babe A red line, danger zone Point of no return coming real close Pulling me in, I'm afraid, I'm warning you, babe   Afraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend But when your heart opens, it's like I’m ready to fall again   Who tripped the red wire out of the blue? Swept off my feet, said, ""God save me now"" How many people dance in a dark room? Swept off my feet, said, ""God save me now"" Is it real love? Is it real love? Ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb I can feel your, I can feel your heart Ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb   Ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb   Afraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend But when your heart opens, it’s like I'm ready to fall again   Who tripped the red wire out of the blue?
