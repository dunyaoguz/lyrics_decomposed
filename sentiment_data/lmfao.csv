Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party Next they wash my body as a team And they say ""Foo, your royal penis is clean!""
