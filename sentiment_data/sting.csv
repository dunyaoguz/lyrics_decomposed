Why, they’d tell him that they had to get a ship built   We build battleships and cruisers (ah) For her Majesty the Queen Super tankers for Onassis, (ah) And all the classes in between We built the greatest shipping tonnage That the world has ever seen   And the only life we’ve known is in the shipyard  Now, gentlemen   Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul We’ll conjure up a ship Where there used to be a hole  But we don’t know what we’ll do If the yard gets sold   For the only life we’ve known is in the shipyard   Why are we makin’ nice with this bloke if he’s just out to shut us down?

Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship As I squinted my eyes in the rain  For the ship had turned into the wind Against the storm to brace And underneath the sailor's hat I saw my father's face  If a prayer today is spoken Please offer it for me When the bridge to heaven is broken And you're lost on the wild wild sea And you're lost on the wild wild sea,3,12,1,3,5,17,19,9,5,7,-0.679

Sometimes I see your face The stars seem to lose their place Why must I think of you? Why must I? Why should I?  Why should I cry for you? Why would you want me to? And what would it mean to say ""I loved you in my fashion""? What would be true? Why should I? Why should I cry for you?",4,4,1,3,8,9,12,8,2,8,0.4137
