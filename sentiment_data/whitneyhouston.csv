Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam In full glory reflected now shines on the stream 'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's desolation Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust"" And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave",0.991,11,15,2,17,14,21,23,7,4,15
