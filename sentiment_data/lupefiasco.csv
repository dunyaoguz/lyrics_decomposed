53,/songs/685225,Lupe Fiasco,DETAILED EXPLANATION OF LUPE FIASCO'S TETSUO & YOUTH,https://genius.com/Lupe-fiasco-detailed-explanation-of-lupe-fiascos-tetsuo-and-youth-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/685225,None,2018-10-01,"--- After listening to Lupe’s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this analysis by getting into the album’s last portion which ran from the season of Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period; I will get into all that later --- The season started with “Chopper” and a lot of people are wondering why a song like ""Chopper"" is on the album. Well, you can't just get into a song like ""Deliver"" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why “Chopper"" is there. It's a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and the gangstas that live in the trap --- Moving onto “Deliver,” like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in “Chopper"" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, ""Pizza man don’t come here no more,” it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can’t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn’t come there no more, and this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence that is preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza; this all goes back to “Chopper” and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn’t come there no more. This one ties into the next song, “Madonna (And other mothers of the hood),” because the piece-of MAN not being there is referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up without them. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so there are significant chances that he’ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations, which will eventually lead to the mother's concern for her child’s well being --- With all the information thus far, I think it’s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words is another name for Virgin Mary, who was the mother of Jesus Christ who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus’s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom’s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus’s crucifixion --- The next song, “The Adoration of the Magi,” contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game, and the next song which he appears in, “They.Resurrect.Over.New."" This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who are not familiar with The Game's background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, “Put You On Game,” which was rapped primarily from The Game's perspective with lyrics from that song that go, ""I’m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.” This song, “Adoration of the Magi” continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist’s albums that had babies on the covers (Ready to Die, Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.) to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering. That’s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it). Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn’t know it; this is why she is wanted by the game, or “adored by the magi.” --- Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song --- Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it’s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, “What if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi?” Here’s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, ""Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus)."" If we look at the phrase from a hood perspective, he is saying, “Madonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstas, drug dealers, killers).” --- Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth, then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth’s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like “we should be closer” and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, “Trapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.” And the only way to get past The Game is to “Proceed to the next level” which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, or the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of proceeding to the next level is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul’s last line, “Unloose the Noose.” That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes --- That is about it for the story, but there is still the concept of the seasons that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? That was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on The Streets again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them --- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It’s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks --- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. If this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece. This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. Lupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever. It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, the cycle will never end ---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season’s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS  P.S. If you listen to the album in reverse, it's basically a documentary of Lupe's life thus far and a message for what's to come",0.997,32,65,25,44,59,55,96,36,26,59

Lupe basically just said, “this is the way.” Now it’s up them. That is about all I can think about in these last 5-7 tracks. If you read this far I hope you have a better understanding of this season’s meaning and message  P.S. This is only a fourth of the album and Lupe’s favorite season on the album is Fall to Winter. I dare someone to decode that season now! :)",0.9948,22,41,18,31,43,38,69,24,15,44

In fact, God insists that adults talk to their children when they sit at home and when they walk along the road. When they lie down, and when they get up. In other words, God is saying, ""Don't mess up the children"". African American families are being driven further and further apart from each other, to the extent their children, particularly those living in urban neighborhoods, are growing up without the benefit of having adults in whom they can confide. Consequently, African-American cultural values are at risk of being lost, like teaching children to respect their elders and saying ""thank you"" or ""no thank you"" and other forms of common courtesy.

Meek Mill,https://genius.com/Lupe-fiasco-lupe-fiascos-take-on-drake-v-meek-mill-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/2257560,None,2015-07-23,"The Haunting  A Letter  To rappers from a rapper...simply write your own rhymes as much as you can if you are able. Ghostwriting, or borrowing lines, or taking suggestions from the room has always been in rap and will always be in rap. It is nothing to go crazy over or be offended about unless you are someone who postures him or herself on the importance of authenticity and tries to portray that quality to your fans or the public at large. Then we might have a problem. Some of the most pivotal moments in rap have been ghostwritten verses. This leads to a bigger point. Rapping is not an easy thing to do. It's takes years of work and trial and error to master some of its finer points. Respect from other MC's comes in many formats. Sales, live performances, realness etc but the one thing that is the most important is the raps themselves at least in the eyes of other serious rappers. The phrase ""I'm not a rapper"" gets thrown around as if it's a badge of honor. And that's fine. If rap is a side hustle for you or just a come up then by all means may the force be with you. But I know a lot of MC's where rap is the first love and the first thing they think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about when they go to sleep. Rappers who pursue the art form with this level of intention may not become rich and famous off selling their raps to a wide audience but that has never been an accepted metric to begin with in terms of quality or level of skill. The vast majority of rappers will never sell 100 records in their lifetimes let alone millions. But that's not the point, the point is that what pursuing the craft gives us in terms of the intangibles is something that record sales or fame could never represent. We achieve a mastery of language and poetics that competes on the highest levels of discourse across the entirety of human history. We express ourselves creatively and attain a sense of liberation and self-esteem via this sacred mode of creation and communication   Modern Radio and the commercial realm of music has injured rap. It set up ambiguous rules and systems for success that don't take into consideration the quality and skill of the rappers craft. It redefined rap as just being a beat driven hook with some words in between and an entire generation has surrendered to chasing the format instead of chasing the art form. While mastering any format should be the pursuit of any self-respecting rapper including the commercial format it must be kept clear that it is just one of many formats and that you should strive to master all of them. The art form is kept alive and progressive in the activities of the tens of thousands of rappers around the world who are everyday trying to think of that next witty bar. Trying to put that crazy verse together while at work. Trying to find that word that rhymes with catapult so they can finish off that vivid story rap about their childhood. Meek Mill struck a nerve accusing Drake of having a ghostwriter and the entire rap world reacted on all sides of the fence because rap is alive. It's active and it feels. Its rules and traditions are vibrant and responsive. I enjoy both these brothers music and find inspiration and appreciation from both of them. I remember being in Toronto at Goodfoot years ago and it was a stack of CD's on the counter and the guy behind the counter was like ""Lupe you gotta take this CD. It's my mans mixtape."" I didn't really pay it any mind I took it to the car and looked it over and just kind of set it aside focused on other things. I vividly remember saying ""what kind of rap name is Drake?"" The rest is history. Once while in Philly I went to do an interview in a shabby and very hood basement studio complex. I peeked into one of the rooms and it was this tall kid with his shirt off bouncing up and down in the booth with an energy that was electric. I gave him my regards. He gave them back. I think I mentioned something about him cutting his dreads. As I left I remember him rapping something about being a boss. The rest is history. At the end of the day, for better or worse, rap is alive even if some of its greatest moments are written by ghosts",0.9968,10,21,3,14,27,15,55,15,6,29

But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy So what powers cowards to get them to the top Just to fall asleep listening to Bach? The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling? And what's the talking without the match feeling That's buried living? And cherry picking Every lemon from your berry system Then proceed with the pack feeding When I was young I had visions of another world Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother, hurled Incense smoke made vortices and other curls Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls I like my pancakes cut in swirls Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms Apologize for my weird mix What taste like hot dogs and tear drips And looks like pantomime and clear bricks And smells like shotguns and deer piss They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard First part of a party, that I throw in parts One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake A word game back up plan that can dam lakes Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine That hovers above cities like weather men And maybe weather woman Whatever better to tell ya weather comin' I prefer girls to reign all over the world And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man But reign like Queens that reign over made man And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, ""Hey man!"" And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements And especially when you're recording Cause that's the portion that's important When I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than (poor) It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops... Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot Cause he want what we got, like yeah  Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery Not scorching, nor sorbet-y From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol Somebody give them the volleyballs If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call My rap position, was black condition, and activism Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?

Because you're a consumer, you're reading all the books And you're saying everything the books are saying But those books are not in alignment with your values! And you're gonna go to the next level Your values are gonna have to change   Uhh, Drunken Fist versus Praying Mantis Was it God's plan or man mismanaged to turn New Orleans to Atlantis? They lie in the streets to lambast The black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub Fire! Cup up the bad blood Hope hand tugs come right after the lackluster backrubs Or half structured or tech hubs or wack love That's stacked as if chance in community chest God said, ""Don’t you ruin me yet Until I give them everything and there’s just two of these left"" Black bumper slow fades into a vista Rapid cuts a stock footage which freezes on a listener Give me love, lovers I read it like blood color on the head of a flooded structure Can't keep the duck rubber under, fundamentally it’s buoyant It rises like court rooms to swoon for your enjoyment   Every single word you said Will you say it to me? Well it stays with me I heard every single word you said Will you say it to me? Well it stays with me, hoohh   Trap music meets trapezoids, fake his own death They roll rocks like asteroids to the crest Think outside the box, I wrap a toy in a cheque Then watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress Mad at the world, in a voice of a man With a bag of a girl, she just avoids the success It's what he said, or what she said Double entendre no matter how you play it Then he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette And puts the ribbon in the sky like the limited of eye Then prepares to utter, what's been a symbol in its side Against the ticker tape scene in a Silver Lake dream Sorta orders the lungs to unmilitate screams Shouts to a forged son with imitate beams In a blue sky filled with pornographic strings Getting caught up in the trees, I still believe in Jesus!   Our purpose is to ensure That literature and art sit well Into the whole revolutionary machine As a component part That they operate as powerful weapons For uniting and educating the people And for attacking and destroying the enemy And that they help the people fight the enemy With one heart and one mind   Every single word you said Will you say it to me? Well it stays with me I heard every single word you said Will you say it to me? Well it stays with me   There was a man who wrote many things But Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined Because no lie could live forever William Cullen Bryan said, ""Truth crushed to earth, would rise again"" And James Russell Lowell, made it more plain That we would not be ruined or destroyed Because he said that, ""Truth, forever on the scaffold, lies forever on the throne But that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch, above his own"" These powerful scriptures were also used by the man In whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr. Martin Luther King And Dr. King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love Non-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far The agape love that we have for ourselves That we have for our people is the reason why our people In this particular diaspora called, North America Have not been totally ruined We have not been totally destroyed, we have not been exterminated So therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, Wasalu We call you, we thank you for what you've asked me to do And we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God Workman that needn’t not be ashamed Rightly this dividing the word of truth And so at this time, in this city Where young men's lives are not worth much In this city where our people have been discriminated against And kept from the resources which we Rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city We are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world That I call Elohim Jehova And we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling To keep us from being ruined, to keep us from being exterminated And we thank the Almighty For the privilege of being here with my niece Is to impart these words And I hope it would be of assistance in this project God bless you and thank you",0.9974,34,31,28,39,29,57,71,31,16,42

And for five hundred years Torture, terror, fear 'til they nearly disappear   This world, my heart, my soul Things that I don't know The icicles they grow They never let me go Scars are left as proof But tears they soak on through Things I've done My young My unforgivable youth   Ways and means from the trade of human beings A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine And helps the new regime establish and expand Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land From native caretakers who can barely understand How can land be owned by another man? Warns, ""One can not steal what was given as a gift; Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish?"" But the lesson went unheeded, for the sake of what's not needed You kill but do not eat it The excessive and elitists don't repair it when they leave it The forests's were cleared, the factories were built And all mistakes will be repeated By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments Foolishness and flaws, greed and needs and disagreement And in your rush to have the most, from the day you left your boats You'll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts   This world, my heart, my soul Things that I don't know The icicles they grow They never let me go Scars are left as proof But tears they soak on through Things I've done My young My unforgivable youth   As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep They discover ancient cars on even older streets And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak A culture so advanced, and by condition of the teeth They can tell that they were civil, not barbaric in the least A society at peace. With liberty and justice for all Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall They would doubt that there was any starvation at all That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved From the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade Everything's so organized. They had to be well behaved Assumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies Religions kinda complex. Kinda hard to figure out But this must be the temple This White House   This world, my heart, my soul Things that I don't know The icicles they grow They never let me go Scars are left as proof But tears they soak on through Things I've done My young My unforgivable youth",0.9422,20,29,11,28,29,35,61,23,12,40
