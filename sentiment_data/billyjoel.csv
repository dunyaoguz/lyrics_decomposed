Is this a curse or a blessing that we give?  Sometimes I wonder Why are we so blind to fate? Without compassion, there can be no end to hate No end to sorrow Caused by the same endless fears  Why can't we learn from all we've been through After two thousand years?    There will be miracles After the last war is won Science and poetry ruling the new world to come  Prophets and angels Gave us the power to see What an amazing future there will be  And in the evening After the fire and the light One thing is certain: Nothing can hold back the night  Time is relentless And as the past disappears We're on the verge of all things new  We are two thousand years",-0.7,7,17,2,13,12,14,17,6,4,12
