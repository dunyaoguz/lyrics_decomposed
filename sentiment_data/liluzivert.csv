Vol. 1,2014-09-19," Where other people stop, I accelerate. People say they're gonna do shit, and they don't do it. I'm going all the way with it, the ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death. When I die, I don't die, my soul goes on, it's another invention. A bottle of death is exciting. Why do I wanna get old and be... nothing? Why do I want to be a poor human being? I wanna do what I wanna do, and get everything done as quick as I gotta do it, and get the fuck out of there, go on, and then I can accelerate into the next life, and still leave my blood here, to be the blood of rock and roll, and still be here, I'll never go away. But when I'm dead, I will become stronger on Earth, and I'll become more powerful in the next life. There is no death, if I kill myself, that doesn't solve the mission, at all. The mission goes on and on and on, and people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that, they don't understand they think ""Yo okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid."" Well you're fucking wrong, you're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant just like people on the jury that convicted me. I don't wanna be like you, I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world, I wanna do what I wanna do, when I wanna end my life, I'm gonna fucking end it, and I'm gonna be more powerful for it. And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong, you're just so fucking... insecure, that you don't have the fucking balls to do it. You wanna say you're bad but you don't really wanna fucking be bad, you just wanna pretend you are. Well I'm really gonna fucking do it and that's what separates the real rock and roll underground from the people who wanna just be pretend.
