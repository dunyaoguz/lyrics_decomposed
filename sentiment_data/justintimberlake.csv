It’s the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I’d rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it?  Well… No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. (Did I mention that I’m having fun with this?? Ha!) *Makes a serious face*  So, here goes:  This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the “grapevine,” I’m gearing up for a big 2013 Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn’t expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I’ve had in my career…  Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process  What I came up with is something I couldn’t be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I’ve discovered along the way  I’m calling it “The 20/20 Experience,” and it’s coming out this year  I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it  That’s all I’m giving you for now… I know, I know! Again, with the teasing!!!  Get ready. This is going to be fun (well, at least it is for me)",4,19,2,6,17,3,22,4,5,8,0.998
