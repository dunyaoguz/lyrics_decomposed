In the lane, snow is glistening A beautiful sight We're happy tonight Walking in a winter wonderland   Gone away is the bluebird Here to stay is a new bird He sings a love song As we go along Walking in a winter wonderland   In the meadow we can build a snowman Then pretend that he is Parson Brown He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man ""But you can do the job when you're in town""  [Verse 3: Boyz II Men] Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland  [Chorus 2: Boyz II Men] In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he's a circus clown We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman Until the other kids knock him down   Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland   We're walking, yes we're walking in a winter wonderland",0.9034,0,5,0,4,5,4,11,0,1,1
