Vorsprung durch Technik Zooropa... be all that you can be Be a winner Eat to get slimmer  Zooropa... a bluer kind of white Zooropa... it could be yours tonight We're mild and green And squeaky clean  Zooropa... better by design Zooropa... fly the friendly skies Through appliance of science We've got that ring of confidence...  And I have no compass And I have no map And I have no reasons No reasons to get back  And I have no religion And I don't know what's what And I don't know the limit The limit of what we've got  Zooropa... Don't worry baby, it'll be alright Zooropa... You got the right shoes Zooropa... To get you through the night Zooropa... It's cold outside, but brightly lit Zooropa... Skip the subway Zooropa... Let's go to the overground Get your head out of the mud baby Put flowers in the mud baby Overground  No particular place names No particular song I've been hiding What am I hiding from?  Zooropa... Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright Zooropa... Uncertainty... can be a guiding light Zooropa... I hear voices, ridiculous voices Zooropa... In the slipstream Zooropa... Let's go, let's go... overground Zooropa... Take your head out of the mud baby  She's gonna dream up The world she wants to live in She's gonna dream out loud She's gonna dream out loud  Dream out loud...",0.7853,1,5,1,5,12,8,20,2,1,12
