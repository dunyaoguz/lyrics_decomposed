heard her say that she was ready to break the law A tricky situation I was currently facing The roommate or ya soul mate whose side are you taking I wasn't saying nothing, I was watching and waiting She's yelling and pacing and now she's adjacent To me, I was standing there quietly He started yelling when she tried to get behind me Then he put up his dukes like he thought he was Ali You swing at

She rubbed me on the face and said it's time to get ghost Your wish is my command, you rollin' I'm rollin' wit' ya You say it's time to split, don't worry I get the picture She grabbed me by the wrist, If I could I would kiss ya In all the chaos I didn't get to tell you I miss ya   I was thinking bout the cut, Like my mind was missing Sitting in the car, You know playing my position She drove

On the Chi block, had two Cartier rings that was iced out A secretary named Lorraine that was quite hot Told me to meet him at the studio, 5 O'clock Try'na get to the studio, picked up in a limo I recorded a demo, and you know my MO H-town slow it way down, here I picked up the tempo Thought it was a Benzo, but he wasn't in a Benzo I hopped out the car and Frank saw me In a parking lot in his Ferrari He opened the door and the leather was looking Godly Real talk, could've cost a mill He was back from New York, he had shopped a deal He met with them talked about my appeal All the labels were talking but not for real Well I think you're wise, and at least ya tried At least we know that they'll see you rise At least you're floating on decent tires I'm headed home but don't be surprised That's where I be if they want me They pro'lly don't but just call me Gave me a couple of stacks Because he knew I was headed right back to the hood, I think it scarred me Then I got on the plane, headed back to Houston like it's part of the game Gave the money to my mother and she couldn't complain Then I headed to the Swishahouse and started a flame Everything started moving up After high school we was cool enough I'm like this ain't got nothin' to do with luck I watched Slim and Braceface candy blue a truck The 312 what I got to dial I called Hurt M Badd like, ""we got a lot to smile.. ..about Hurt, we can make a profit now I need beats because we're about to put an album out"" That conversation wasn't friendly Thought he had some beats that he could lend me But he told me that they have a price tag And a beat from him would cost 10 G's That's when my heart turned empty I wasn't trying to get them free but didn't think that you would rob me I recorded all them songs for you and never asked you for a dollar Now you tryna charge me? *click* On the window pane we can all see the rain Somebody gotta let me know what part of the game is this Wait, now I got a call from Lorraine, ""Hello?"" What's up, she's no longer working with Frank at all And told me the reason she made the call Is to tell what really happened with the major talk ""They liked you Cham and they said you're raw They liked your music but hated all the rest of the artist He told them, nah, you wanna sign him? Gotta pay us all"" I knew that I wasn't ever signed to her I knew that I wasn't ever signed to Frank And Frank, he already had a lot of bank I'm never letting anyone decide my fate Who knew that I would do what I do? Who knew that Michael Watts would try to screw what he screw Who knew that Ron C was good at screwin' it too? And how can anybody act like they had a clue?

Two straps on me, never dealin' with a pat down While I'm walkin' to the private jet in the background! I didn't see a throne, that's why I never sat down! Pass it to the king like cats out in Sac-Town! No Demarcus, I don't give a damn, it's no instagram, I'm just into Cham'! Open hands and then enter grands; anythin' I got, I'm gon' get again! Killin' all y'all, tell me what do y'all call! Bad guy that never pass! I the villain ball hog! You on the come up but I'm playin' ""duck hunt"" When I put my guns up, that's the day that y'all fall!   You ain't playin' in the game; you a lame, you a mascot! Always trynna criticize the things that we rap 'bout While I'm movin' like a pair of J's on the blacktop; You don't run a thing but out of space on your laptop! I'm a start a tab my change never max out Main broke rapper, main one pullin' cash out! Ima have yo' woman on swangs in my Lac drop You don't like it? You can catch a fade like a flat top Lame get a name, y'all lames tell 'em: ""That's hot! "" Not me! I say I never bought it, boy! I'm comin' for the money like an auditor Look how I murdered everybody that you thought was raw! It don't mean that you made it if you on a tour; You're not a headliner if you're on a four! Anybody got beef, I'm a carnivore Don't make me rain on your parade like it's Mardi Gras! Not Mardi Gras, it's not February! Not January, it's Ben & Jerry! Mixed with some liquor, it's a Bloody Mary Such a nasty flow it's unsanitary! Gettin' motion sickness cause I roll the sickest On the road to riches and you know the business; Cause the flow is vicious, you supposed to witness; When I get it, I'mma be like: ""What I told you, snitches?

If this was the NBA then you all woulda got a broom Woulda swept ya right out the series for copying other plays It worked for the other team, so you trying to throw up a trey I would empty the bench and replace all you clowns any day Who told you you could be Jesus Shuttleworth anyway?

Listen I’m on a mission, so you just get in the car Voices all in my ear say ""try not to get involved"" Didn’t give me the option but I'mma get rid of ya The ill mind of Koopa is telling me ""kill 'em all""",13,16,7,11,16,24,41,10,9,30,0.9512

Shall I tell you a story? Shall I tell you a dream? They think I'm crazy They don't know that I like it here   See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her The name of my record company, she says (you a singer)  I said my name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer Oh you that guy they talking about when they be whispering ancient Bring your name up when they talking and say money will change ya I heard a lot about how you can't deal with your anger  Heard the rumors 'bout how your always in trouble or danger  Not gonna judge you if it's true, so there's no need to explain sir Cause you do have a right to be, you seem like ya nice to me I'm 'bout to order me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?  I tell the bartender same Hennessey on ice for me Her drink starts emptying while she's spillin' out her life to me  Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be Invitin' me into a session of her life and she Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me She pulls out her picture phone ""I got pics, would you like to see?"" I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell Giving her soul to me, it's like an identity sell We never met is the story that my memory tells Telling me tales like she doesn't handle Hennessey well Getting into it, getting intimate and into details See, I just met you and you showing me your kids ""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids"" Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let me show you just who it is""     Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel Knew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hang a Round this part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see She said she wasn't married but the ring on her finger Told me that she was lyin' and just using the same uhh Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you He told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you He said what he said with a passion like it was so true Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around To find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town"" I turn around to see two officers coming in now They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground So close that they can listen to either of us now We turn back around and then she says no need for whispering Then she tells me ""I don't really give a damn whose listening Try to make it last a long time was my mission And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him Hit 'em with my fist and them punches were never missing him""     Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how Wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile She said pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile as power Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower Damn what do you mean? I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him? She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him She stops then I say ''Ay keep talkin I'm listening'' I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing Henny spilling then she tell me For real and That the feeling that I was feeling is that I wanted to kill him Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian Her voice was getting louder, the moral is getting clearer The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her Told me It was protection, Reached for it in the stash The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at last Baby I think you crazy, I'm sorry I'm pressing for time I gotta go grind, time’s been interesting Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing That this conversation is two types of evil confession She pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend How you know him? She told me that she was with him at his house Watching movies for Sundays when they be chilling And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him The feeling was the worst feeling she possibly could be feeling Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why the hell did you kill him?""
