Rewind! I remember that night, I just might I remember that night, I just might I remember that night, I remember that—   I remember that night, I just might Regret that night for the rest of my days I remember those soldier boys Tripping over themselves to win our praise I remember that dreamlike candlelight Like a dream that you can’t quite place But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first Time I saw your face I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame This is not a game…   You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself You’re like me, I’ve never been satisfied Is that right? I have never been satisfied My name's Angelica Schuyler Alexander Hamilton Where’s your fam’ly from? Unimportant, there’s a million things I haven’t done Just you wait, just you wait...   So so so— So this is what it feels like to match wits With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s A dream and it’s a bit of a dance A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants   Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it! I wanna take him far away from this place Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is   Helpless And I know she is Helpless And her eyes are just Helpless And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time   I’m a girl in a world in which My only job is to marry rich My father has no sons so I’m the one Who has to social climb for one Cause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious And Alexander is penniless Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less  (Doesn’t mean I want him any less) (Doesn’t mean I want him any less) (Doesn’t mean I want him any less)  He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister And that elevates his status, I’d Have to be naïve to set that aside Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza Now that’s his bride Nice going, Angelica, he was right You will never be satisfied  (I will never be satisfied) (I will never be satisfied)   I know my sister like I know my own mind You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned He’d be mine She would say, “I’m fine” But she’d be lying  But when I fantasize at night It’s Alexander’s eyes As I romanticize what might have been If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly At least my dear Eliza’s his wife At least I keep his eyes in my life…   To the groom!
