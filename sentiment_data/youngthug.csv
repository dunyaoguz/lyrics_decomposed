A: nothing in the first 30 seconds, everyone knows you want to wait until the 45 second mark..dick. And I've never mentioned an expensive car in anything, for what it's worth. No, valid question. I make a product for a certain audience and I'm good at it. Supply and demand, simple economics.

Saigon played himself out in that role  Q: What's your view on music piracy?  A: Piracy is good for underground artists, thanks to google people search the fuck out of songs to find the original artist. You end up getting more exposure as a indie artist. At this point I'm just happy my music is getting out. My management hate the shit though and now that music is the product they see piracy as money out of our pockets. I focus on music, I let them stress legalities and royolaties  Q: How did you first release your music into the public sphere? How did you start to generate publicity for yourself? What advice would you give to people who are trying to pursue this same dream?  A: I just started doing a shit ton of collabos with other artist that already had established followings A strong and constant internet presence, a street team out promoting shows and appearances, You have to have a team you trust, people that know their talents and understand your vision and your goals, people who let you focus on your talent, believe in you, and will call you on your bullshit in a minute  Q: How old are you and what crimes have you committed?
