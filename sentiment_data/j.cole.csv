Ayy, who am I? (Yeah)   Things change, rearrange and so do I It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold One time for my mind and two for yours I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see   I always did shit the hard way My nigga  slangin' in the hallway Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker Some Reggie Miller With more brown hairs than Chewbacca Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that? He tell his pops he need some lunch And he gon' get it right back I peep game Got home snatched my mama keychain Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front do' His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though I told her hello, and sat with my nigga and laughed And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that? Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure 17 years breathing his demeanor said more He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now? If you wasn’t my mans I would think that you a clown right now Listen, you everything I wanna be that's why I fucks with you So how you looking up to me when I look up to you? You bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices: Either graduate to weight or selling number two For what? A hundred bucks or two a week? Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me? I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us If they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"" I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear And thought about how far we done came From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me And show you that I can fly And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive Ayy, who am I?   Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?) It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?) I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold I might bend a little bit but I don't fold One time for my mind and two for yours I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul If you see my tears fall just let me be Move along, nothing to see   I never felt better",0.9236,17,19,15,12,17,34,34,16,6,21

Ben kimim? Onlardan birinin beni disslediğini duydum, şaşırdım Yaklaş küçük adam, seninle konuşmama izin ver Bakalım senin için büyük resmi çizebilecek miyim Tebrikler, annenin evinden ayrılabildin Umarım annene bir ev alabilecek kadar kazanırsın Bakıyorum saatin parıltılı ve araban pahalı Bir tavsiyem var, tur yapmayı asla bırakma Çünkü bu günlerde biz rapçiler böyle kazanıyoruz Garip lil rap isimlerinle dalga geçiyorum Müziğini duyuyorum ve rap'in değiştiğini biliyorum Bazıları bunun kötü bir şey olduğunu söyleyebilir Çünkü artık her şey reklama dayalı ve pop Trap drumlar havalı olan şeyler artık Görüyorsun, yeni nesil için bir görevdeyim Neyse boşver, bu sadece bir geçiş Söylemem gerekli ki parçalarından etkilenmedim, hey Ancak siyahi birinin para kazanması hoşuma gidiyor Ayrıca bu işten zevk alıyorsun ve buna saygı duyuyorum Ancak yarattığın etki üzerinde hiç düşündün mü? Bu beyaz çocuklar senin hiç bir şeyi umursamamanı seviyorlar Çünkü tenin siyah olduğunda senden bunu bekliyorlar Senin dab atmanı bekliyorlar, senin hap atmanı bekliyorlar Suratından topuklarına kadar dövme içinde olmanı bekliyorlar Ve derinlerde bir yerlerde, siktir, gerçekçi olmam lazım Onlar siyahi olmak istiyorlar ve parçalarının öyle hissettirdiğini düşünüyorlar Yani sen bir şey yaptığında onların da yaptığını görebilirsin Sonraki şehire geç, zamanı geldiğinde paranı topla Paranı alıp, sürtükler içinde yüzüyorsun, seni suçlamıyorum Ancak benim ve senin gibi gözükmeye çalışan insanları düşünmüyorsun Doğru, yapman gereken daha önemli şeyler var Kazandığın paralarla bir varoşu satın alabilirsin Biliyorum bu gelir hiç bitmeyecekmiş gibi hissediyorsun Ancak sana bunun doğru olmadığını söylemeliyim Bir gün seni dinleyen çocuklar büyüyecek Ve senin patlamana sebep olan şey için çok yaşlı olacaklar Artık onlar gelmediği için şovların zayıf gözükecek Ve bu ne yazık ki paranın azalması demek Şimdi tekrar göz önüne gelmek için umuyor ve kıvranıyorsun Ancak trendleri takip ettiğin için patladığını unutuyorsun Şimdi sen eskidin ve pişmanlıklar içinden geçiyorsun Çünkü o evi satın almadın, yerine Benz aldın Onlarca mücevher ve ayakkabı aldın Onlarca sahte arkadaş edindin, seni yargılamıyorum Sadece rap yaptığın konu hakkında rap yapmaya  devam edersen neler olacağını söylüyorum Dibe gitmek için iyi bir rota Sana iyi şanslar diliyorum İyiliğin için göründüğün kadar aptal olmadığını umuyorum Ancak insanların söyledikleri gerçekse Gerçekten benim adımla dalga geçiyorsan O zaman gerçekten boku yediğini bilirim, güven bana Sonsuza kadar çevrende olurum çünkü yeteneklerim yeri boylamak isteyen tüm zenciler için kusursuz İşler boka sardığında dediklerimi hatırla Beş yıl içinde Love&Hiphop'a çıkacaksın zenci",-0.4291,1,1,1,0,1,2,2,0,2,1

I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19 Took me two felonies to see the trap This crooked-ass system set for me And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be The one that set examples that was never set for me I'm living fast, but not fast enough 'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand   For your eyes, do you understand?

Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized My definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doing time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked In a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only  [Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole] For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only  [Verse 4: J. Cole] One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice And it was chilling, he said: ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing, when times was hard I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit But that shit was in my blood, you know my life I know your momma, nigga, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects"" I had to interject like: ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"" He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions But I been having premonitions Just call it visions from the other side I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow Like the time I'm living on is borrowed With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father Write my story down, and if I pass Go play it for my daughter when she ready"" And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son I dedicate these words to you and all the other children Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation That sent your pops to prison when he needed education Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better Although I know that means that I would never Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old Now it's 30 years later, making sure this story's told Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold Not because he was the first To get some pussy 12 years old Not because he used to come through In the Caddy on some vogues Not because he went from bagging up Them grams to serving O's Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"" Although that was true Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you For your eyes only",-0.9767,40,40,29,42,37,69,70,29,27,57

So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn when he got out the car. He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and he fired 7 more shots and my friend died   All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free",0.9585,9,3,0,11,6,14,15,7,13,15

My question is why did you create the website stream for the album before it even came out?  Cole - so fans didn't feel so bad for listening early 2. What did your homie who was disappointed your first Dead Presidents freestyle think of the second one?  Cole - he was silenced forever. wasn't my homie, knew him through somebody else. but he's on Mute now 3. If there was one thing you could've done differently music-wise, what would it have been?  Cole - sell Friday night lights 4. What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?  Cole - Eric Clapton 5. Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?  Cole - DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini 6. Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner? Can you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?  Cole - First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses! Production process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete Born sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggas Thanks for the question 7. What internet sites do you frequent, non-music related?  Cole - can i be honest? without getting killed off by Reddit community. I go to Digg a lot. I know Reddit ethered Digg a while ago, because of the amazing COMMUNITY experience of reddit. But I still rock with them Don't taze me bro 8. Why wasn't the beat that was used in the first Born Sinner uStream used on the album?  Cole - Didn't like the verses on it! they were hard but sometimes a beat is so good it's overpowering and intimidating. that beat is like that 9. What did you have for lunch today? Also, what's your favourite music video? Yo i got another one, what's your favourite kind of booze?  Cole - haven't eaten yet today. you just reminded me that i need to eat 10. Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your “Faggot” bars on Villuminati?  Cole - yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation 11.  What was the most meaningful song on Born Sinner? To me it felt like you poured your heart out and went all in on this album. Love the work. Keep it coming, you're for real, man. Changing the game..  Cole - There is a lot of MEANING on the album. so most meaningful is hard. But I really love the title track ""Born Sinner."" Because even though there's lots of pitfalls, temptations, dangers, and tribulations on the album, it ends in a hopeful place with ""i'm a born sinner, but i'll die BETTER than that"" listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship (got her life in my grip), family (she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised), friends (if i died today my nigga was it business, was it personal?) Thank you 12. Kid Cudi self-produced the whole album, Indicud, like you did on Born Sinner. What is you personal opinion on INDICUD?  Cole - I haven't heard INDICUD because I was working on my album. But I'm really mad at myself for not finishing a verse for that album in time. Got in the studio with Cudi and he was cool as shit. Good dude. I never did my verse and the joint was harddd 13. One thing that I think everyone here wants to ask: Can you tell us anything new about your upcoming album with Kendrick Lamar? I really love Born Sinner by the way, can't wait to see where you go next, but I want to emphasize how good what you're doing right now is. And thanks for doing this AMA!  Cole - Thank you. This question will be asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. We have some really good songs in the stash, but haven't had a chance to properly work on a project. An album will come in the future, but probably not this year. I'm just happy for my niggaaa 14. How did it feel when you heard Nas on Let Nas Down Remix?  Cole - Surreal. Today is my first day off in a LONG TIME (other than this. but this isn't WORK) I plan on soaking in that moment tonight and really reflecting on how amazing that is 15. What made you want to work with James Fauntleroy? He is incredible  Cole - This is weird. You asked me a question. And then answered your own question 16. did you have a fan base before you you got signed?  Cole - yes. i called them friends That was it really. few hundred people had heard The Come Up, and School Daze was popping on my myspace page. No buzz though. Just skeelz 17. Favorite nba team?  Cole - no real team loyalty. just follow players now. Looking for a home. my last favorite team was the KNICKS because Penny Hardaway's last real playing years were there (and i just happened to be in NYC for college). Before that it was the Magic, then the Suns. NEVER FAVORITE A TEAM BECAUSE OF A PLAYER, when he leaves you're gonna be lost in the world 18. So....have you met Jay Electronica? How's he like? Who's your favorite celebrity that you've met/would like to meet?  Cole - jay electronica has the most phone numbers out of anybody i ever met. He changes his number every 16 hours 19. How did you celebrate the release of born sinner? Cole world  Cole - got twisted tuesday night with friends and fam in NYC while feeling really grateful and relieved and blessed and happy 20. COLE I HOOKED YOU UP WITH THAT GIANT BORN SINNER PIC BY YOUR NAME, PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE YA BOY'S EXISTENCE  Cole - acknowledged 21. Congratulations on Nas's remix to your joint Cole! Listening to your songs I often get chills. Songs such as God's Gift, Return of Simba, See it to Believe it and too many songs off of Born Sinner! Has there ever been a song you've heard whether it be from Nas or someone else that has blown your mind and influenced your style greatly?  Cole - Nas- Undying Love Eminem- Stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers 22. Why Did you try and compete with Kanye on the 18th? Wouldn't it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition?  Cole - Just followed my instincts. I was confident in the album I had. Didn't know what he had, but didn't care. Wanted to start the conversation. I've had a #1 album before. It's cool. But I wouldn't have been able to live with myself wondering ""what if I would have moved my date?"" 23. Hi J. Cole. I have a few questions for you but first off I would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an AMA here on HipHopHeads. I've been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. I really wanted to come to your Atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but I found out that there was an age limit, and I am only 15 What are your favorite things to do outside of rapping? What job would you like to have if you didn't rap? What has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far? Do you think of yourself as ""famous"" now that you have had two successful albums? Are you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for Born Sinner? I would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus Thanks again for doing this AMA, I am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases  Cole - If I didn't rap I have no clue what I would want to do. Would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. Too much passion for music to think of something else right now Hardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. How to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. Took a lot of experimenting, trying things, sometimes failing. But I found it Born Sinner CROWN Hoodies on the way 24. What did yourself and Drake do with all those copies of the album you bought? What was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance?  Cole - I don't even know what happened to those copies. Hopefully they gave them out to the people My first feeling when the album leaked 12 DAYS IN ADVANCE. was ""oh fuck"" 25. Thank you for doing this AMA J. Cole, to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special 3 days before Sideline Story dropped I was at your concert in Tampa, and you shouted me out at the end while doing Farewell, I was the white kid wearing a Dreamville shirt, here's a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtNJLZ1 When you have your next concert in Tampa, or the closest other venue, I plan on wearing a shirt that says ""Produce with J. Cole or Die Trying"" I would really just like to get some advice on producing, it's become something I love to do, and you are amazing at it Anyways, my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol, Nas, rap over your own song, saying that he is proud of you? Thank you once again, I've been a fan since The Warm Up, and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. Sorry for fan girling, but I've seen in interviews how you've talked about how much you liked Nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him, and that's exactly how I feel about you. Keep making amazing music, and thank you for helping bring back the real  Cole - thank you. i'm going to do a real tour in the fall I answered the Nas question. Really just wanted to say thank you for listening. And I just heard we beat Edward Snowden for #1 on Reddit. AND I AIN'T HAVE TO BETRAY THE US GOVERNMENT!!! jk jk jk jk (does anyone still use jk.. felt like a 12 year old girl typing that) 26. What are your favorite shows on TV? (More importantly, do you watch Breaking Bad?) lol  Cole - Newsroom is my favorite show. House of Cards too. Breaking Bad is incredible, I only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. But never had time. So NO, I don't watch it but wish I could 27. Hey Cole. Born sinner is easily the best album that came out on June 18th and your production and rapping was on point. I got two questions for you 1) Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner? 2) When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick? Thanks for doing this ama Cole!  Cole - Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was ""who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?""  2) Don't want to put a date on it 28. If you could, would you have done Born Sinner differently?  Cole - nope",0.9999,43,54,39,46,60,66,124,51,24,77
