Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!   So I took her down to the shoreline The weather that day was so fine And not to mention she looked pretty good too And later at the movies, romantic comedy I hate those films but for her I managed to get through I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes As I desperately tried to say something she put her finger on my lip and said one more thing   She kissed me and knocked me off my feet Never have I ever felt this way I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!   It's nice to know that she cares enough about me I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same About that other girl's name   Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet Never have I ever felt this way I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!",0.9941,2,6,2,3,9,2,10,2,3,8
