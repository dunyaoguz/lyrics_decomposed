Every time we drive the coast Heading toward Las Vegas in your car?  Playing on your broken speakers Me asleep and warm inside your arms No it's never like what it used to be Maybe it's just never really was  But every night when I get home I can hear your voices in the halls Every night when I'm alone I can hear your voices in the halls,0.3484,3,4,1,5,2,6,4,3,2,0
