The way I feel about my life right now is as if I don’t Do something quick that I might end up sick or homicidal Appreciate the blessings lingering in my vibrato Administrate the lessons I’m singing in my recital Give it another title, call it the daily bread A special formula you fix to get the baby fed It's brain food, that kind they ooze into a baby’s head So he won’t be misled and when the baby’s dead Bury him where they buried Terry just to grow a tree up They cutting down the rainforest looking for space to free up And paving paradise with parking lots where buildings be up What is the world coming to? It’s really messing me up I got a brand new nephew in about a year His lungs will be older than he is from the cloudy air Not saying cloudy like the molecules of H20 I’m talking about the factories and fumes, whatever you know And every time I’m driving, I’m thinking ""I’m such a culo!"" My contribution of pollution isn’t very cool though But what am I to do though? I got to work to live And if I happen to be living where my working is Then will I ever learn to celebrate it through my kids One day I’ll have 'em maybe but first I need a lady And will I give her all my time and will she really love me And will she give me shelter when the storms are up above me I know sometimes it be my personality is ugly And no amount of make up can make up for that But know I recognize a game and when I’m up to bat I’m gonna put a little change into the thinking cap Because to change the world you gotta change your mind We can’t go on living wrong inside of the same design It gotta be that you and me agree to make a difference Put up a canvas and manipulate the color pigments To paint a portrait of tomorrow full of broader figments In your imagination could you imagine nations? At peace and harmony instead of genocidal warring Where borders don’t exist and nobody’s considered foreign Mother Earth is respected, animals are protected Society perfected, Capitalism's rejected What is the world coming to? Almost the end of us And it’s the evils in the world today we tend to trust How could we let the ashes crumble till they come to dust I guess that’s what is meant to happen if you blind enough If you ready for what is coming, then come on with me Follow my voice, if you can hear it let the song lift me Into the graces of Heaven’s hugs, to learn love’s embrace And share with every beautiful face I place my right hand on my heart And say, let me be the start I pound my fist on my chest and request Allow me to be the test, and when I’m at my best I can make a Catholic priest confess Cause guilt is worse than the parasite in his flesh And the flesh is weak but the pride is strong And it can make a little lie last a little bit longer Than it was ever intended by whom ever intended to send it Watch the evil manifest that it rendered And I hope you remembered your place in this Look up at a shooting star, go 'head and make a wish Hopefully it will be granted by the gods Against all odds you’ll be wise enough to see through the facades What is the world coming to? I wish I had a answer Better than seeing human beings as a living cancer Better than being what I’m seeing hope I have a chance to Raise the consciousness Peace ya’ll and god bless   Blind World",0.9976,10,32,14,15,26,29,47,14,6,30
