Is this the bed I chose to make? There's greener pastures I'm thinkin' about Wide open spaces far away   All I want is The wind in my hair To face the fear but Not feel scared   Wild horses I wanna be like you Throwing caution to the wind I'll run free too Wish I could recklessly love Like I'm longing to I wanna run with the wild horses Run with the wild horses   I see the girl I wanna be Riding bareback Carefree along the shore If only that someone was me Jumping headfirst Headlong without a thought To act and damn the consequence How I wish it could be that easy But fear surrounds me like a fence I wanna break free   All I want is The wind in my hair To face the fear but Not feel scared   Wild horses I wanna be like you Throwing caution to the wind I'll run free too Wish I could recklessly love Like I'm longing to I wanna run with the wild horses Run with the wild horses I wanna run too   Recklessly abandoning myself before you I wanna open up my heart Tell him how I feel   Wild horses I wanna be like you Throwing caution to the wind I'll run free too Wish I could recklessly love Like I'm longing to I wanna run with the wild horses Run with the wild horses Run with the wild horses I wanna run with the wild horses,7,8,1,6,3,19,5,3,12,11,0.9972
