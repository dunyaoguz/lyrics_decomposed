Which way is wrong? How do I say that I need to move on? You know we're heading separate ways   And it feels like I am just too close to love you There's nothing I can really say I can't lie no more I can't hide no more Got to be true to myself And it feels like I am just too close to love you So I'll be on my way   You've given me more than I can return Yet there's oh so much that you deserve Nothing to say Nothing to do I've nothing to give I must live without you You know we're heading separate ways   And it feels like I am just too close to love you There's nothing I can really say I can't lie no more I can't hide no more Got to be true to myself And it feels like I am just too close to love you So I'll be on my way So I'll be on my way   And it feels like I am just too close to love you There's nothing I can really say I can't lie no more I can't hide no more Got to be true to myself And it feels like I am just too close to love you So I'll be on my way So I'll be on my way",0.9984,5,1,3,4,11,5,13,4,1,7

Maybe I'm just too demanding Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold  Maybe you're just like my mother She's never satisfied Why do we scream at each other? This is what it sounds like when doves cry  Touch if you will my stomach Feel how it trembles inside You've got the butterflies all tied up Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride  How could you just leave me standing Alone in a world so cold?
