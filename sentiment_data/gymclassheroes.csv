And my mouths the definition of so fresh and so clean (clean) I feel it's only right, since my words all I got And nobody wants to listen when your breath is hot But that's a story in itself so I head to my bedroom Throw on some drawers and pick out a costume I think ill rock these blue jeans and this tee shirt And whats a little polo sport gonna hurt? C'mon   This is that day cause I can feel it You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit As the birds chirp your favorite tune It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb Cause everything is so serine And the temperature is just right Not a worry in sight And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day   Shall I continue where I left off? I'm feelin' kinda lovely but my Tummy is growlin' so I'm feeling kinda hungry So I hit the kitchen and I'm wishin' there's some food in sight What do ya know? I got that Cinnamon Life And now I'm real happy, fill my salad bowl up with cereal To my surprise it's Jackson Five up on the stereo I turn it up my words can't describe my reaction to Wakin' up and listening to prepubescent Michael Jackson Open up the Frigidair what do we have here? Seems like just enough milk to fill my morning craving Peep out the window just to see if Izzy is misbehaving He's staring at me with a grin like 'Yo, let me in man!' So I begin to fill his dish with Kibbles N' Bits Let him in so he can eat, and I'm eating my shit So now we both full and well fed Happier than that fat rat Templeton from Charlotte's Web And now its time to get our walk on Izzy can get his bark on It's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on I know the lake is at its finest (you better take afvantage) I'll grab my backpack, this leash, and maybe make a sandwich I better grab my ghetto blaster and a few tapes A thurmos full of water and a bag of fresh grapes Some more tapes cause you know that music comes first And what's a little Jackson Five gonna hurt?

G C H  Hi, have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to some music? Well this is your big chance You see, music is much like a brocaded butterfly, with a shadowy promenade of effervescence, yet sloops down the bottom of misty mountains of darkness Like a flirtatious flounder upon a non-reflecting mirror God, what is this opaque window of comfort, that we cannot overcome? It is a manifestation of love It a forest of emptiness and it is an ocean with no water except where that which fills it So as you listen to this masterpiece release yourself from the prison of captivity and let your soul free Because only a free soul can be captured by greedy soul thieves Who will have sold it to Leprechaun gold miners But it is only when your soul is taken away, that you can take it back And this my friend, does not make any sense whatsoever, or does it, no it does not Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Papercut Chronicles",0.8897,3,3,2,6,7,8,11,9,2,6

Back in 2005 I introduced the world To The Papercut Chronicles Now I'm back from retirement To blow your mind once again But what is a mind? Is it a simple conglomeration Of neuron-transmutation Or a dense emptiness where Immortal dreams lay to die? Some say one's mind is a state But is Pennsyltucky a state? No, not since 1985 One moon to the next The selenophobic skies sparkle Between the darkest of stars Like the dance of an inanimate sparrow Wallowing amidst the iridescent shadow A marsupial fetus bellows beats Across a melodic menagerie And with a fleeting slothfulness The silent sounds of an invisible mountain rise Below the cloud forest But if a forest makes a sound Does a fallen tree hear it? No one can know, except for those that do For a cocoon of love is nothing If not a prison of sorrow And out of love and sorrow A callous confusion creeps Into your conscious Germinating into the rhythm Of harmonies never forgotten  Ladies and gentlemen I give you The Papercut Chronicles Part II",0.8956,4,5,2,7,8,9,14,7,2,8
