Now this book was a testimony of the experience he'd had as a combat infantry man in southeast Asia. Week or two later, I'm bunked in at the fabulous Sunset Marquis Motel in Los Angeles. Uh, for the uninformed, it's kind of an upscale, uh, low-life rockstar hangout, alright? Uh, small world theory. Small world theory proves itself once again. I been seein' a young guy with shoulder-length hair sittin' in a wheelchair by the pool for several days. So uh, one afternoon, he rolled up to me and said, ""Hi, I'm Ron Kovic. I wrote a book called 'Born on the Fourth of July'"". I said, ""Jesus, I just, I just read it, and when it, it destroyed me"", and, he spent the afternoon Talkin' to me about many returned soldiers who were struggling with a wide variety of problems and he wanted to know if I'd take a drive with him to the vet center in Venice, meet some of the southern California veterans. So I said sure, next day we headed out there and I'm usually pretty easy with people, but once we were at the center, I didn't know how to respond to what I was seein'. Uh, talkin' about my own life to these guys seemed frivolous. There was homelessness and drug problems and post-traumatic stress, and young guys my age dealing with life-changing physical injuries, and it made me think about my own friends from back home. Walter Cichon. Walter Cichon was the greatest rock 'n' roll frontman on the Jersey shore in the bar band 60's. He was in a group called The Motifs, and he was the first real rockstar that I ever laid my eyes on. He just had it in his bones, he had it in his blood, it was in the way he carried himself. On stage, he just, was deadly. He was raw and sexual, and dangerous and in our little area, he taught us, by the way that he lived, that you could live your life the way you chose, you could look the way you wanted to look, you could play the music you wanted to play, you could be who you wanted to be, and you could tell anyone who didn't like it to go fuck themselves. Walter had a guitar playin' brother, Raymond. Raymond was tall, tall kind of sweetly clumsy guy, one of those big guys, who just isn't comfortable with his size. He's always like, ooh, ooh, knockin' into shit wherever he is, and wherever that is, there is just not enough space for Raymond, for some reason. And uh, but, but then strangely he was always dressed impeccably, ya know, with a pastel shirt, long pointed collar, shark skin pants, nylon socks, spit-shined pointy toed shoes, slicked back black hair with a little curl that would come down when he was playin' the guitar. Uh, Raymond was my guitar hero. And he was just a shoe salesman in the day. And uh, Walter I think worked construction, and they were only a little bit older than we were. Never had any national hit records. Never did any big tours. But they were gods to me. And uh, the hours I spent standing in front of their band, studying, studying, studying, class in session, night after night watchin' Ray's fingers fly over the fretboard and Walter scare, the shit outta half the crowd, oh man. Ya know, they were essential to my development as a young musician. I learned so much from Walter and from Ray. And my dream was I just wanted to play like Ray, and walk like Walter",-0.9478,11,12,5,11,11,25,28,12,6,18

Bart Hanes was the drummer from my first band, The Castilles. He was the first real drummer I ever played with. He was absurdly funny kid, classic class clown, was a good good drummer, with one strange quirk - couldn't play ""Wipeout"" by The Safaris. This may not seem so critical to you right now, I understand, but, in those days, your skills, your mettle, your self-worth as a drummer and as a human being, was tested in front of your peers once an evening by your performance of ""Wipeout"". Now Bart could play every other fucking thing, but when it came to ""Wipeout"" - beyond his capabilities. Was tragic, ya know. One day, he got off, he got up off the drum stool, he joined the Marines, then uh, Walter and Bart, they were both killed in the war in 1967 and '68. Bart was the first young man from our hometown to give his life in Vietnam. So, I really didn't know what to say to the guys I was meeting in Venice. I sat there for most of the afternoon and just listened. Then in 1982 I wrote and I recorded my soldier story. It was a protest song, the G.I. blues. The verses were just accounting of events, the choruses were a declaration of your birthplace, and the right to all the blood, and the confusion, and the pride, and the shame, and the grace, that comes with birthplace. 1969, Mad Dog, little Vinnie, and myself, we were all drafted, on the exact same day. All three of us. We rode together early one Monday morning from the selective service office on probably the unhappiest bus that ever pulled out of Asbury Park. Because we were on our way to what we were sure was going to be our funeral. We'd seen it already, all very up close. And when we got to the Newark draft board, we did everything we could not to go. And uh, we succeeded, all three of us, when I go to Washington, and I vacation to visit Walter and Bart, I'm glad that Mad Dog's, little Vinnie's, for that matter, my name, isn't up on, on that wall, but it was 1969 and thousands and thousands of young men to come would be called, simply sacrificed, just to save face for the powers that be, who by then already knew, they knew it was a lost cause. And still thousands and thousands of more young boys. So uh, so I do sometimes who went in my place, because somebody did",-0.9767,6,10,4,5,10,10,19,7,6,5

But uh, all I know is the streets were dead empty and the whole place looked like it'd been locked down since 1955. My corner church was silent and unchanged, no weddings, no funerals, I, rolled slowly another 50 yards up my block to visit my great tree and it was gone. It'd been cut to the street since the last time that I had drove through. So I got out of the car and I looked down, and there was a square of musty earth that held the remaining snakes of its roots on the edge of the parking lot. So I reached down, I picked up a handful of dirt and I just kinda ran it through my hands, and my heart sank like, like a kid who suffered from irretrievable loss, ya know, like, like some, some piece of me was gone. Um, I don't know I guess I, it was just it had been there long before I was, I assumed it would be there long after I was gone, and I liked that. It, it felt eternal. It was at the, it was at center of our street and it had rooted our neighborhood for so long. So I sat there for awhile just cursin' the county and listenin' to the sounds of the evening come on and I looked again and I realized it was gone but some, some essential piece of it was still there, the air and the space above its roots. I could still feel life, and soul, and the light, my childhood friend there. It's just that its leaves, its branches, and its massive trunk were now outlined, shot through by evening stars and sky. But my great tree's life couldn't be ended or erased so easily, from this place because it's history. And history matters. Its imprint was too great, it was too old, and it was too strong, it had been there too long, to be done away with so easily. It had stood witness to everything that had happened on these small streets beneath its arms. All the joy, and all the heartbreak, and all the life. And when we live amongst ghosts, always trying to reach us, from that shadow world, and they're with us every step of the way. My dead father's still with me every day and I miss him and if I had a wish, oh man I - I wish he could've been here to see this. But I visit with him every night, little bit, that's a grace-filled thing. And Clarence, I get to, I get to see him be with Clarence a little bit every night.

Doesn't dissipate so quickly. Souls remain. They remain here in the air, in empty space, in dusty roots, in sidewalks that I knew every single inch of like I knew my own body, as a child, and in the songs that we sing, ya know. That is why we sing. We sing for our blood and for our people, because that's all we have at the end of the day - each other and, maybe that's what I'm lookin' for when I go down there, I just wanna commune with the old spirits, stand in their presence, feel their hands on me. One more time. Um, anyway, once again I stood in the shadow of my old church ya know, you know what they say about Catholics - yeah, there's no gettin' out. Nah, no, they gotcha, they gotcha, the bastards got ya when the gettin' was good. They did their work hard and they did it well, 'cause the words of a very strange but all too familiar benediction came back to me that evening, and I wanna tell you these were words that as a kid, I mumbled these things, I sing-songed them, I chanted them, bored out of my fucking mind, in an endless drone before class every fucking day, every day the green blazer, the green tie, the green trousers, the green socks of all of Saint Rose's unwilling disciples, ya know. But for some damn reason, as I sat there on my street that night, ya know, mourning, mourning my old tree, and once again surrounded by God, those were the words that came back to me and they flowed differently. Was ""Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven.

It takes a little courage, and a very strong partner. 'Cause in this life you make your choices and you take your stand and you awaken from that youthful spell of immortality where it feels like the road's gonna go on forever. And you walk alongside your chosen partner with the clock ticking, and you recognize that life is finite, that you've got just so much time, and so together, you name the things that'll give your life in that time its meaning, its purpose, its fullness, its, its very reality. And this is what you build together, this is, what your love consists of. This is what you, this is your life, ya know. And these are things that you can hold onto when the storms come, as they will",0.9856,3,4,0,2,2,6,13,1,0,8

I wanted to know my story, and your story. Felt like I needed to understand as much of it as I could in order to understand myself. Ya know, who was I? And where I came from and what that meant. What did it mean to my family? Where was I going? And where were we going together as a people? And then, and, what did it mean to be an American? And to be a part of that story, in this place, and in this time. I wanted to be able to celebrate and honor its beauty, its power, and I wanted to be able to be a critical voice when I thought that that's what the times called for. But most of all, more than anything else, I wanted to be able to tell that story well to you. That was my young promise to myself, and this was my young promise to you. From when I was a very young man, I took my fun very seriously, ya know. And this is what I pursue as my service, I still believe in it as such. This is what I have presented to you all these years as my long and noisy prayer, as my magic trick. I wanted, I wanted to rock your very soul, and have you bring it home and pass it on, and I wanted it to be sung and altered by you and your folks and your children, should they be interested. I wanted it to be something you could call on when things were good, and uh, and when things were not so good - that it might strengthen, help make sense of your story and your life the way that you strengthen me and help me make sense of my life. You've provided me with purpose, with meaning, and with a great great amount of joy. I hope I've done that for you and that I've been a good travelling companion.

Because these are fans who are waiting for you to pull something out of your hat, out of thin air, something out of this world, something that before the faithful were gathered here today was just a song-fueled rumor.

Well, in the beginning, there was a great darkness upon the waters, as a child, it was Christmas, your birthday, summer vacation, but the rest of life was a lifeless sucking black hole. A lifeless sucking black hole of homework, church, school, homework, church, school, homework, church, school, green beans, green beans, fucking green beans. But then, then a blinding flash of sanctified light, a human being, and just a kid, just a kid from the southern sticks, but uh, new kind of man, he split the world in two, and suddenly, a new world existed. The one below your belt. And above your heart. Sunday night in 1956 at 39 and a half Institute Street into a Coldwater flat and into the mind of a seven year old kid, the revolution had been televised! Right under the noses of the powers that be, who if they'd have known what was actually happening and the great changes, the changes that were about to come, they would've shut this shit down, or more likely, signed it up real quick, because we the unwatched, the invisible, the powerless, the kids, would want more. Now more life, more love, and more sex, and more hope, and more truth, and more power, and more soul, and most of all, more rock 'n' roll. So I sat with my mom, my little seven year old mind on fire, staring into a blue tube as fun happened. Fun, the real kind. The joyful, life-affirming, hip-shaking, ass-quaking, guitar-playing, mind and heart-changing, race-challenging, soul-lifting bliss of a freer existence. A freer existence exploded into unsuspecting homes all across America, on a regular Sunday night. The world had fucking changed. In an instant. In a sweating wet orgasm of fun. And all you needed to do to get a taste of it, was to risk being your true self. Because the rock 'n' roll genie had been let out of the bottle and he told us that if you were born in the U.S.A., my fellow citizens, these feelings, these freedoms, this fun, was your birth right. I listened, I believed, and I heard a mighty call to action. So, I studied my new hero. And I noted he's got the same two arms, two legs, two eyes that I got. Yes, he's a human Adonis, and I'm - pathetically creepy. But I'll figure that part out, alright. The one thing he had that I didn't have was strapped around his waist. It was the guitar. The guitar, or as my father had christened it, ""That fucking guitar"". But that fucking guitar was the key. It was the sword in the stone, it was the staff of righteousness, and they sell 'em at Western Auto downtown for 25 dollars! So I begged and I pleaded with my mother just to rent me, 'cause we couldn't afford to buy a guitar from Mike Deal's Music School on South Street. One Saturday afternoon, I brought it home. And I sat on the living room couch. And I unlatched its full alligator case, and I slowly opened it up. And up from the green velvet lining came the sweet smell of a cherrywood cocktail of power, pleasure, salvation, and dreams and dreams and dreams. So I took lessons, dedicatedly, I took lessons for two solid weeks, and I quit. It was too fuckin' hard. Learning the guitar, not only was it fucking hard, but the lessons were boring, just give me the three magic chords please! And let me twist! And shout. But I was a seven year old kid and my hands barely fit around the neck and I couldn't waste my mother's hard-earned cash week after week so very shortly I knew, that back it was gonna have to go. But the morning before I returned it, I strapped it on one more time. I took it out into the backyard where the neighborhood kids were. And I put on my first show. Woo! I slapped it. I shook it. I shouted. I sang voodoo nonsense. I burned a hole in the grass. I shook my little seven year old ass, woo! Most importantly, I posed with it. That's the shit! I danced with it, I did everything but play it. I couldn't do that. I sucked so bad and the kids laughed and laughed at my silly ass. And we brought it back that afternoon. Ridin' back home, with my mom in the car, sat in the backseat and I was quiet, was thinking, I was a little disappointed, in myself. But somewhere inside, somewhere inside I knew that for a moment, just a moment, in front of those kids in that backyard, I smelled blood   I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere You know it's really hard to hold your breath I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress My feet they finally took root in the earth But I got me a nice little place in the stars I swear I found the key to the universe In the engine of an old parked car I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd But when they said, ""Sit down,"" I stood up Ooh, growin' up Ooh, growin' up   And it was bye-bye New Jersey! I'm gonna be airborne!",0.9987,18,42,12,27,46,40,76,26,14,55

Alright, this is the final days of Patti's first pregnancy. And I receive a surprise visit from my father at my home in LA. Now he'd driven 500 miles unannounced to knock on my door, that's his style. So at 11 a.m. we sit Sunday dining room, and we're nursing morning beers, that's his style. That's my father's breakfast of champions. When, my dad, never a talkative man, right, blurted out, ""You've been very good to us"". And I nodded that, that I had, ya know, and uh, and he says, ""And I wasn't very good to you"". And, the room just, was, stood still. As to my shock, ya know, the acknowledgeable was being acknowledged, if I, if I didn't know better I would've sworn an apology of some sort was being made, and it was. Here in the last days before I was to become a father, my own father was visiting me to warn me of the mistakes that he had made, and to warn me not to make them with my own children. To release them from the chain of our sins, my fathers of mine and our fathers before, that they may be free, to make their own choices and to live their own lives. We are ghosts or we are ancestors in our children's lives. We either lay our mistakes, our burdens upon them, and we haunt them, or we assist them in laying those old burdens down, and we free them from the chain of our own flawed behavior. And as ancestors, we walk alongside of them, and we assist them in finding their own way, and some transcendence. My father, on that day, was petitioning me, for an ancestral role in my life after being a ghost for a long long time. He wanted me to write a new end to our relationship, and he wanted me to be ready for the new beginning that I was about to experience. It was the greatest moment in my life with my dad, and it was all that I needed",0.6788,2,12,2,8,8,8,14,3,7,16

Now to a child, bars in Freehold were these citadels of great mystery. When you walked through bar room doors in my hometown, you entered the mystical realm of men. On the rare night, that my mother would call my father home, we would slowly drive through town until we drew to a stop outside of a single lit door, she'd look at me and say, ""Go in and get your dad"". This both thrilled and terrified me. It thrilled me because I had been given the license by my mother, the law, to go into the bar! I'm a kid! But it terrified me because to enter the bar is to enter my father's priveleged, private, and sacred space. He was not to be disturbed when he's down at the bar. Everybody knew that. So I would walk in, and I was waist-high, like a Jack who climbed some dark beanstalk into a land of giants, all I remember is the men towering over me on their way out the door. Now once you were in, to the left against the wall was a line of red leather booths that were filled with husband and wife tag team drinkers. Now there were your hardcore regulars there night after night after night, alright now to the right was the bar, a line of stools filled by a barricade of broad working class backs clinking glasses, too loud laughter, and very few women. I would stand there lost in the noise and the hustle of the crowd and I would drink in that dim smell of beer and booze and aftershave. Now to a kid, that was the scent of adulthood. It was the scent of manhood. I wanted some of that. And finally somebody would notice me, and draw me over to my pop, now my view from the Ford was the first thing I'd see was the chrome legs of the barstool. Then I'd see his black shoes, white socks, dark green work trousers, powerful legs and haunches, my dad 'til the day he died had the legs and the ass of a rhinoceros. And, and his trousers always looked like they were stretched. stretched over that legs and ass somehow, I don't know how. He was always bustin' out ya know, uh, then I would see his black Garrison work belt, his green work shirt, and then his face. By the time I got there his face was flushed red, red as a tomato because he was Irish and whatever he drank went straight to his face, alright. He couldn't hide a thing when he came home, ya know, uh, and not only was it red, like it - it was like distorted too, into some sort of booze mask, by, by Mr. Schlitz and, and, it was so foreign to me as a child that, it - he - fuck I don't know, ha ha, but it was scary and he'd be peering down over his shoulder, down at the cigarette smoke and he'd be lookin' at me like ""I've never seen you before in my fuckin' life"". I then uttered the immortal words that I was sent to deliver - ""Mom wants you to come home"". I'd hear, ""Go outside, I will be right out"", and I would follow my breadcrumb trail back out the bar room door, I would hop into the backseat, and I would inform my mother, ""Um, he'll be right out, he'll be right out""",-0.8014,4,14,5,7,12,19,23,9,4,21

That's the only way we have, in our power, to get the closeness and love that we needed and desired. So when I was a young man looking for a voice to meld with mine, to sing my songs and to tell my stories, well I chose my father's voice. Because there was something sacred in it to me. And when I went looking for something to wear, I put on a factory worker's clothes, because they were my dad's clothes. And all we know about manhood is what we have seen and what we have learned from our fathers, and my father was my hero. And my greatest foe. Not long after he died, I had this dream, I’m on stage, I’m in front of thousands of people, and my dad's back from the dead and he’s sitting in the audience and suddenly I'm kneeling next to him in the aisle, and for a moment we both watched the man on fire on stage. And then my dad who for years, he sat at the kitchen table, unreachable, but I was too young, I was too stupid to understand was his depression. Well I kneel next to him in the aisle, and I brush his forearm, and I say, ""Look dad. That guy on stage - that's how I see you.""   My father's house shines hard and bright It stands like a beacon calling me in the night Calling and calling so cold and alone Shining ’cross this dark highway Where our sins lie unatoned",-0.7843,11,15,5,11,14,21,17,14,7,12

It's just built into the equation of growing up. If you take me, I'm Mr. Born to Run. I'm Mr. Thunder Fucking Road. I was born to run, not to stay  My home, New Jersey - it's a death trap. It's a suicide rap. Listen to the lyrics, alright. I had to get out, I gotta hit the highway, I'm a roadrunner man, I got the white line fever in my veins, I am gonna bring my girl and I have had enough, of the shit that this place dishes out. I am gonna run, run, run, and I'm - well I'm never coming back  I currently live ten minutes from my hometown. But uh, born to come back, or uh - who would've bought that shit? Nobody  And in our front yard, only a few feet from our front porch stood the grandest tree in town. It was a towering beautiful copper beach tree, and on sunny days, I lived under its branches, its roots, where a fort for my soldiers and a corral for my horses, and I was the first on my block, to climb high into its upper reaches, leaving behind a world that, I didn't care for much already  And up near the top, I had the wind in my face and I had all the dreaming room that you could want. On slow summer nights, I'd sit beneath its arms with my pals like the cavalry at dusk, just listening, listening, for the evening bells of the ice cream man. My grandmother's voice calling me into bed  I lived on Randolph Street, but my sister Virginia, she was a year younger than me, my parents Adele and Douglas, my grandparents Fred and Alice, and my trusty dog Saddle. We lived spitting distance from the Catholic church, the priest's rectory, the nun's convent, the Saint Rose of Lima Grammar School, all of it, just a football's toss away, across the field of wild grass. I literally grew up surrounded by God  Surrounded by God, and my relatives, 'cause we had cousins and aunts and uncles and grandmas and grandpas and great grandmas and great grandpas, so all of us were jammed into five little houses on two adjoining streets, and when the church bells rang, the whole clan would hustle up the street to stand witness to every wedding and every funeral that arrived like a state occasion, in our little neighborhood",0.9902,9,16,6,7,14,8,22,5,7,20

Then run up the street and throw it at the next wedding, and the next wedding, and the next wedding. We also had front row seats to watch the townsmen in their Sunday suits carry out an endless array of dark wooden boxes to be slipped into the rear of the Freeman's Funeral Home long black Cadillac for the short ride to Saint Rose Cemetery Hill on the edge of town. And there, all our Catholic neighbors, all the Zirilli's, all the McNicholas's, all the Springsteens who came before, they patiently waited for us. On Sundays, as my mom tended to our graves, my sister and I, we played hide and seek amongst the gravestones. I gotcha. Now when it rains in Freehold, when it rains, the moisture in the humid air blankets the whole town with the smell of moist coffee grounds wafting in from the Nescafe plant from town's eastern edge. Now I don't like coffee. But I love that smell. Was comforting, it united our town, just like our clanging rug mill, and a calm and sensory experience. There was a place here. You could see it. You could smell it. A place where people made lives, and where they worked, and where they danced, and where they enjoyed small pleasures and played baseball and, and suffered pain, where they had their hearts broke, where they made love, had kids, where they died, and drank themselves drunk on spring nights, and where they did their very best, the best that they could, to hold off the demons outside and inside that sought to destroy them, and their homes and their families, and their town. Here we lived in the shadow of the steeple crookedly blessed in God's good mercy one and all. In the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, race-rioting, freak-hating, soul-shaking, redneck, love and fear-making, heartbreaking town, of Freehold, New Jersey",0.9891,8,8,4,10,9,16,16,8,2,10

I'm Outlaw Pete! I'm Outlaw Pete! Can you hear me?

I'm Outlaw Pete! Can you hear me?   He cut his trail of tears across the countryside And where he went, women wept and men died One night he woke from a vision of his own death Saddled his pony and rode her deep into the West Married a Navajo girl and settled down on the res And as the smoke fell he held that beautiful daughter to his chest   I'm Outlaw Pete! I'm Outlaw Pete! Can you hear me?   Out of the East on an Irish stallion came Bounty Hunter Dan His heart quickened and burdened by the need to get his man He found Pete peacefully fishing by the river, pulled his gun and got the drop He said, ""Pete, you think you've changed, but you have not"" He cocked his pistol, pulled the trigger and shouted, ""Let it stop!"" He drew a knife from his boot, threw it, and pierced Dan through the heart Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun And whispered in Pete's ear, ""We cannot undo these things we've done""   You're Outlaw Pete! You're Outlaw Pete! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?   For forty days and nights Pete rode and did not stop Till he sat high upon an icy mountain top He watched a hawk on a desert updraft slip and slide Moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side  Some say Pete and his pony vanished over the edge Some say they remain frozen high upon that icy ledge The young Navajo girl washes in the river, skin so fair And braids a piece of Pete's buckskin chaps into her hair   Outlaw Pete!

Bands are all about what happens, they're musicians, who come from the same streets, the same passions and influences, who go in search of lightning and thunder. They come together in a whole that is greater than the sum of their parts. They may not be the best players, that's not necessary. They need to be the right players, and when they play together, there is a communion of souls, and a natural brotherhood, and sisterhood, manifests itself, and a quest, a quest is begun, you’re in search of something, an adventure's undertaken, and you ride shotgun.

Excellent, grasshopper! But nobody captured my audience's imagination or their hearts like Clarence. Clarence was, Clarence was a figure out of a rock 'n' roll storybook, and together, we told a story that was bigger than any of the ones I had written in my songs. It was a story where not only does Scooter and the Big Man bust the city in half, but we remade the city. We remade the city shaping into the kind of place where our friendship and our love for one another wouldn't have been such an exceptional thing. First night I saw Clarence he came walkin' out of the shadows towards the band stand, nodded to me, got up, stood to my right, for the very first time. He picked up his saxophone, and when he played - when he played, he whispered that story in my ear. And then we whispered it into your ear, and we carried it together for a long, a long good time. The Big Man was big. Everything about him. His personality, his size, his laugh, the sound of his saxophone. When I first heard it I thought it was the biggest sound I ever heard. And it was. His heart, his problems - they were big. But he was elemental in my life. And losing him was like losing the rain. If I were a mystic, if I were a mystic, I guess Clarence and mine's friendship would lead me to believe that we, we stood together in other older times, ya know and uh, in other lives, along other rivers, in other ancient cities, in other fields, workin' side by side, with the sun settin', doin' our modest version of God's work. I'll see you in the next life Big Man   When they made that change uptown And the Big Man joined the band From the coastline to the city All the little pretties raise their hands I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze-out   Ladies and gentlemen let's hear it for the biggest man you ever saw Clarence ""Big Man"" Clemons And the legendary E Street Band That's it Oh yeah, it's alright Yeah!",0.9981,6,14,2,10,19,10,44,10,9,19

I never believed that people came to my shows, or rock shows in general, to be told anything. But I do believe that they come to be reminded of things, to be reminded of who they are, that they're most joyous at their deepest, when life feels full. It's a good place to get in touch with your heart and your spirit. It's good to be amongst the crowd, be reminded of who we are and who we can be collectively, and music does those things pretty well. Sometimes, they can come in pretty handy. And particularly these days, some reminding of who we are and who we can be isn't such a bad thing, ya know, uh. I uh, I re- I refer back to the weekend of the March for our Lives when we saw all those young people in Washington and citizens all around the country remind us of what faith in America and what real faith in American democracy, and how sacred that is. When uh, that weekend, you just saw what it actually looked like and felt like. It was just encouraging, to see all those people out on the street and all that righteous passion alive in the service of something good, to see it still there at the center of the beating heart of our country, and, in spite of what we've been goin' through, it was a good day ya know, it was just, it was just one good day. But it was a necessary day. Because these are the times when we've also seen folks marching, and in the highest offices of our land who want to speak to our darkest angels, who want to call up the ugliest and the most divisive ghosts of America's past, and they want to destroy the idea of an America for all. That's their intention. That's what we've been seeing in the outrage of the broken families on the border, and in hate-filled marches on American streets, this year. Things I never thought I would see again in my lifetime. Things that I thought that were dead and gone forever, on the ash heap of history. Ya know uh, ya know we've come too far and worked too hard, too many good people paid too high a price, and paid, paid with their lives to allow this to happen now. Ya know. There's been too much hard work done, and sacrifice. There's a beautiful quote by Dr. King that says, ""The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice."" It is important to believe in those words and to carry yourself, and to act accordingly, to live with compassion, and have faith in that what we're seeing now, is just another hard chapter, in the long long ongoing battle for the soul of the nation",0.9936,8,25,3,7,19,10,40,5,10,26

Now, I have some confidence. I've been around a bit, and without a doubt, I am definitely the best thing that I've ever seen. I've already played in front of every conceivable audience. I had played fireman's fairs, midnight madness supermarket openings, drive-in movies, uh, in front of the concession stand in between films, I've played beach parties, offices, clubs, pizza parlors, coffee shops, bowling alleys, trailer parks, roller rinks, VFW halls, CYO canteens, the elks lodge, YMCA gymnasiums, hockey rinks, county fairs, carnivals, high school dances, weddings, fraternity parties, bar mitzvahs, soul revues, battle of the bands, Sing Sing Prison, and Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital.

Let me explain this to you. I live in the boondocks. There is nobody here and no one comes down here. It's a grave. There was no Jersey, Jersey, Jersey Shore, Jersey Almighty shit. I invented that. Before me, Jersey was Jeserkistan. Jeserkistan! One of the little -stan things that nobody knows a fuckin' thing about, ya know. And New York was a million miles away from the Jersey Shore. In my little town as a child we knew no one who had ever been to New York City. Jesus Christ, it was only an hour away! But no, you might as well have said you're goin' to the fuckin' moon! ""Hey, we're goin' to the moon, you wanna go?"" ""No, no, no, no New York, we're provincial, everybody was afraid ya know, everybody was afraid of the big city.

We got up on a little stage that fit 150 people, was about half full, and we played for this guy like we were at Madison Square Garden. Everything we had, all night long. We played five sets from 9pm 'til 3am. At the end of the night, I was soaked to my bones, I got off the band stand, this guy walked up to me, looked me in the eye, shook my hand and said, ""You guys are the best unsigned band I've ever seen"". Then he slept with my girlfriend and left town. That's the end of that story. It's a sad ending, ya know. But that was enough for me. I gathered together the men, and I said, ""Gentlemen, we are going to have to leave the confines of the Jersey shore and venture into parts unknown if we wanna be seen, heard, by anybody, or discovered"". Now, I found a manager, surfboard manufacturer from the west coast, he'd moved east by the name of Carl Virgil ""Tinker"" West. Now, together he, Mad Dog Lopez, and myself, we lived in the surfboard factory, in the industrial wastelands of Wanamassa, New Jersey. Tinker said he had some remaining rock 'n' roll contacts in San Francisco so we all got excited, and he said if we could get there, somethin' might happen. So we saved up all our money until we had 100 dollars, alright?. And then me, Danny Federici, Mad Dog Lopez, little Vinnie Roslin our bass player, rigged out Danny's station wagon for the drive, put a mattress in the back for the drivers to spell each other into sleep, then on the way out there, we rigged Tinker's old 40's flatbed to carry our equipment, and we had three days to make it across the country for a New Year's Eve gig in Big Sur, California. Now three days means those are gonna be thousand mile days. You can make it, but you can't stop. You stop for gas and for nothing else. You drive, drive, drive, drive, 72 hours straight, somebody's drivin' all the time, around the clock. Now of course we lost Danny and the entire station wagon full of drivers in Nashville, Tennessee. Now, there's no cellular phones - young people, take a moment. Let's try it. Imagine a world without the cellular phone.

I go, ""Tink, I can't drive"". He says, ""Springsteen, there's nothing to it. Idiots all over the world are doin' it"". ""Oh yeah?"" He pulls me into a parking lot, he puts me behind the wheel, I start grindin' gears, pumpin' the clutch, jerkin' the truck all over the lot, it's a 1940's manual transmission and I can't get past first gear! After a moment Tinker says, ""This isn't gonna work"". But I got another idea. He gets in the driver's seat. He slips in the clutch. He smoothly shifts it into first. He eases out on the clutch. He gets that truck goin' on a sweet little roll, looks at me and says, ""Now let's switch seats"". And that's what we did. I was fine in second, third, and fourth, and I could keep it in between the lines as long as I didn't have to stop or go near first gear. If I gotta do either of those things I have to wake up Mr. West, alright. Now, it doesn't matter because he's awake anyway, because the guy who can't drive is drivin'! You're not gonna sleep through that! So, uh, you'd be surprised how far you can go across this big country without having to stop, ya know, it's, it's a long ways between things out there, and man I drove my share. 2000 miles in second, third, and fourth gear. Without killing anybody. Uh, and we made it on time, ya know, but - that trip was, was where I saw the United States at its fullest, and as a young man I was overwhelmed by its size and its beauty and, this is a short piece from the book about riding across the country for the very first time. The country was beautiful, and I felt a great elation at the wheel as we crossed the western desert at dawn. The deep blue, purple shadow canyons, pale yellow morning sky, all of its color drawn out, leaving just the black silhouetted mountains in your rear view mirror. And then with the eastern sun rising at our backs, the deep reds and the browns of the plains and the hills came to life slowly in front of us. Our palms turned salty white on the wheel from the aridity. Morning woke the earth into this muted color, and then came the flat light of the midday sun, and everything stood revealed as pure horizon. Just sky, sky, sky, and more sky. Lowering on the two lanes of black top, and disappearing into nothing. My favorite thing. Then the evening, with the sun burning red into your eyes, and droppin' gold into the western hills in front of ya. All felt like home to me. And I fell into a lasting love affair with the desert",0.9953,3,20,3,5,14,13,29,10,10,15

I wanna release you from suicide watch right now. Snap out of it, come on. Because my  mother was bright, happy, she'd merrily make conversation with a broom handle, she believed that there was good faith, good heart, good hope in all citizens. She gave the world a lot more credit perhaps than it deserves, but that was her way. Now on school mornings, I hated school, that's just rockstar 101. If you don't hate school in my business, please keep your fucking day job alright? Because it's a sign, it's a sign that, brother, you're going nowhere man, nowhere. You need to have hatred in your heart to get to the top where I am, alright? You've got to hate on, uh - so of course I hated getting up and uh, my mom had perfected this technique in the morning where she'd stand over my bed with a glass of ice water and give me 30 seconds, eh you know, ""Five, four, three, two"", boom! Niagara Falls. I would get dressed, I would drift downstairs to breakfast where I would feast daily on a huge bowl of sugar pops, a fine product, with just one problem - they don't put enough sugar in those sugar pops. So I wasn't content until I snowed more sugar on my sugar pops until they looked like the Himalayas, and then mmm good, with a buzz on, and a kiss from my mom, I was off, with my sister, lumbering up the street with our book bags, as my mom's high heels clicked lightly in the other direction toward Lawyer's Title Insurance Company in town center, she was a legal secretary. That was a job she did since the day she got out of high school, fifty years to follow. Goes to work, doesn't miss a day, never sick, never down, never complains, work doesn't appear to be a burden for her but it's a source of energy and of social pleasure. Now, some evenings I would meet my mother at closing time and we would be the last to leave the office and this was always a great privilege to me. I would have my mother all to myself, and with the building empty, her high heels would echo down the long linoleum hallway, and with the fluorescent lights out, lawyers' cubicles empty, secretaries; desks empty, typewriters covered, silent, the building was so still, after all the noise of the day ya know it was so, it got so quiet, it was as if - it, it was as if the building itself was resting after a long day of service in the interest of our town. And then suddenly we'd be through the front door and out on Main Street in five o'clock rush hour and she would stride along, statuesque, and, I'd be runnin' alongside her just, trying to keep up and I would be, ya know, looking up at her, and uh, it's a sight I've never f-, never forgotten - my mother walking home from work, had some - just some eternal impact on me, ya know uh, she uh, she always had these very ethnic features, she had coal black hair, Italian olive skin, and when she was young she wore that red lipstick, that was very fashionable, in the 50's. And she'd be looking down at me with a look that for me, was like the grace of Mary, Made me understand for the first time how good it feels, feel pride in somebody that you love, and who loves you back, ya know. She let the town know that we are handsome, responsible members of this shit dog bird, pullin' our own individual weight doin' what has to be done day after day, we have a place here that we have earned, and we have a reason to open our eyes at the break of each day and breathe in a life that's steady and good. My mom was truthfulness, consistency, good humor, professionalism, grace, kindness, optimism, civility, fairness, pride in yourself, responsibility, love, faith in your family, commitment, joy your work, and a never-say-die thirst for living - for living. For living and for life. And most importantly, for dancing. My mother and her two sisters were dancing machines, alright. They grew up in the 40's with the big bands and the swing bands, and they, and they learned the jitterbug, and, and uh, it was in their bones, ya know, uh, my mom is seven years into Alzheimer's. And she's 93. But dancing, and the desire and need to dance is something that, it hasn't left her. Remains an essential primal part of who she is, it's beyond language, it's more powerful than memory, and when she comes in the door, we make sure there's music on. She wants to dance, ya know. These things were the embodiment of my mother, they were her heart, she carried on and she carries on as if they never, never deserted her",0.9992,9,32,11,15,32,30,68,22,20,42

That was a feeling that, oh, I loved. Maybe that's why I became a musician. Um, sleep late, stay up late, and you do an awful lot of leavin'. The night I left Freehold for the last time, I laid back on the couch that was perched high atop a load of the band's junk furniture in the back of an open flatbed truck on a beautiful summer night. I was 19 years old. That felt pretty good. Soft ocean breeze of the shore was reaching all the way inland, and as we drew through town, for the very last time, we were stopped by the police, who informed us that there was a law against moving after dark. What the fuck?  Who the fuck would know that? Don't move your shit after dark? What are we running off: one of Freehold's great antiquities? The sun goes down, they'll bust your ass in Freehold, son. Anyway, they uh, they sent us on our way, glad to be rid of the town hippies I guess, and so I laid back on my couch, and I was watchin' the tree branches brush above me and the stars glowing in the night sky, and I remember it felt absolutely wonderful  I had nothin'. No parents, they'd moved away with my, little sister Pam, to California in 1969. My sister Virginia, great soul that she is, she got pregnant and had a baby at 18, she left high school, married a competitive bull rider, and they moved into the wilds of southern New Jersey because, that's where the cowboys live. The real joke is that fifty years later, they're still together and they still go to the rodeo  But I had no money and no family and no realistic future but yet I remember layin' on that couch with the summer wind rushin' over me, and ya know that salt water smell in the air of the shore comin' on, thinkin', I was just happy, I was happy. I got it all, ya know, maybe I did, ya know. Maybe there was nothing like that moment in your life with being young and leaving some place, all that youthful freedom, you feel, finally being untethered from everything you've ever known, the life you've lived, the past, your parents, the world you've gotten used to and that you've loved and hated  Your life laying before you like a blank page. It's the one thing I miss about getting older, I miss the beauty of that blank page, so much life in front of ya. Its promise, its possibilities, its mysteries, its adventures.
