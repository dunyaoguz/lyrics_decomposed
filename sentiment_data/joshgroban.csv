Where we laughed till we cried and our love grew stronger with every fight There'll be a thousand moments for you to say ""I told you"" And a million more for us to say ""I love you"" So let's look forward to you and I looking back At 99 years like that, at 99 years like that   They build a house of love in the face of worry But life has a way of rewriting the story There were times when it looked like nothing could save them And there were times when it looked like nothing could break them They keep promising each other what the future's gonna hold   Will we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life? Where we laughed and we cried and our love grew stronger with every fight There'll be a thousand moments for you to say ""I told you"" And a million more for us to say ""I love you"" So let's look forward to you and I looking back To 99 years   Of nothing unspoken Live every day hoping That when we feel broken Our scars make us golden Still choose you and I   Will we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life?
