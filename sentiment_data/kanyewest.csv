My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that! We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know.

That's why I called her! So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, ""Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next."" And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, ""Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney."" And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!  They tell me, ""Don't compare yourself to these people,"" right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West  (Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!  Tonight, we're here to have fun. I'm standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy. I'm standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West. I'm standing in front of the future, Chance The Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. Bro!

Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West  Dr. Kanye West: I’m sorry, that was just my opinion  I am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas  “I’m sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits. I didn’t know he was an artist  I felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is “I need to get rid of that feeling.” I need to not be nervous  This honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don’t have to defend me as much, and I’m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it’s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I’ve been saying my entire life. Whether it’s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, “It’s okay, he doesn’t bite white people,” or the New York Times cover, or the Time “Most Influential” cover, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of Chicago  When I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school because when I went on that mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier if I could have said: ""I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago.""

What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, ""no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval."" So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin', like I've calmed down and shit and like come back to Earth. So, you know, for the editor of Rolling Stone, I wanted to say that. But I do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was, information in the article that was incorrect. And you know, if you allowed me to proofread it, the people could've had the proper information. And just to speak to the Dave LaChapelle, 'cause Dave LaChapelle's one of my favorite photographers, modern-day Warhol. I wanna speak to the cover. You know, people say, ""Okay well he has a god complex."" Fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate Christ, do they have a god complex? Are they allowed to do that? You know, it's because of my position, it's like I'm not allowed to be creative. So every cover I take has to just be a picture of my face and shit, just... look it's my face! It's me! And sometimes it's like after you see—after I see me so much, I get tired of me and shit... I gotta look at me every day! I wanna do shit that's exciting to me. So the Rolling Stone's cover was exciting to me, that shit went down in history. I did it purely for creative reasons, it was't speaking upon you know, anything disrespectful to Christianity, to anything like that. It was something I did purely creative. Lot of times I do shit and people take more out of it. You know like I said Bush doesn't care about Black people and then people took it and said, ""Well you said, ""Bush hates Black people."""" You know, everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be. When you know, I just say, I express something. You know, the other day somebody came to me like, ""Okay well who you voting on? Barack or Hillary?"" And I'm like I'm not really political dawg, I'm not getting into like you know I'm taking sides and this type of thing. He's like, ""What do you mean you're not political? You're not..."" I was like, fam! I'm emotional! I'm social! I'm like... I'm an artist! Like if you give me the opportunity, I'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit. I'm the glitch in the matrix, I'm like the last person to say, yo I really feel... I know I'm supposed to feel like this and know I'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever, but I feel like this what I wanna say. That doesn't put me... I'm never going politically incorrect or anything. I don't know about politics like that. I just know about people. I make music for people",23,7,15,9,11,33,39,11,3,19,0.9984

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay."" Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with  So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you  And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""  No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""    I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer  [Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]  I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't be Life.""  And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""  [Jay-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]  And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said  [Jay-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]  ""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""  [Jay-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]  And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...  [Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]  ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...  [Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]  ...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX  [Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]  And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""  [Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]  ""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""  [Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]  You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""  [Jay-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]  That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...  [Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]  I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up  [""Y'all niggas is stupid""]  Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad  [Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]  Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""  [Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]  Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'  ""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow I got eleven plaques on my walls right now You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""  Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""  [Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]  ""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""  [Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]  Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""  [Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]  ""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""  [Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]  And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""  So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you...",48,50,46,12,39,53,110,17,26,77,-0.9998

Don’t let nobody but you  You know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I’m uncontrollable or something. Like I don’t do what I’m supposed to do. You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are  Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star  You know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies  You know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight. We goin’ out of control tonight. Ahh  How many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome?   Now with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn’t fucking awesome?   See this is what I’m talking about.This is what I’m talking about. This is what I’m talking about. I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking about  How many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?  You see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not —  making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit,  people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I’m not going to say no names or anything  But if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?  And they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”  That’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will  And I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terrorist  You know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do  Let’s have a toast for the douchebags  Source: Vulture",27,15,25,13,20,43,42,23,13,37,0.9938

I ain't here to apologize to no motherfuckers, man. It ain't about me humanizing myself. At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation. I ain't a fucking celebrity. I ain't running for office. I ain't kissing nobody's motherfucking babies--I drop your baby and then you sue me and shit  I'm trying to make some music that inspires people to be the best they can be -- And I don't want nobody to ask nothing else of me! Don't ask nothing else of me. Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit.

Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu type important performance, let me just say that right quick. I love the energy in this city - this is one of my all-time towns y'all know I stay out here. But I came here for the creativity more than anything, because creativity fuels everything  I hate business people. People get on the phone with me and tell me ya know like, 'What kind of business can you do, though? What type of business are you doing? What's the numbers? How much did you sell? What's the radio spins? How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?  Remind me again why we in this shit Can you remind me again why we in this shit?  Remind me again why we in this shit (3x) I know it's for more than to just get rich Since when was making music about getting rich? Since when was making art about getting rich? And I know it's easy for me to say cause Having money's not anything and not having it is  Remind me again why we in this shit Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick  Remind me again who's the original Superfly - And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that ""Suit and Tie.""  Remind me again Remind me again why we in this shit - Every nigga tryin' get rich Every rapper tryin' get rich And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch  Remind me why we in this shit - And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick  And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter And they'll show you what they just bought her  Remind again why we in this shit - Real niggas don't live too long in this shit. (x5) They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit - They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK!

I swear I'll put the pink polo back on. I swear to you. Please. Just for three million dollars. I need it so bad. I need a new pool in my back yard. So I tell all my fans that your shit is cool. And if they believe in me they should also believe in you. Did you get the check yet? I have to call a business manager - did the corporations send the check yet? What's my public rating right now? Are people liking me again? Enough to get money from the corporations - is it OK now? They forgot about the whole Beyonce thing right? Okay cool. Is it OK now?  Remind me why we in this shit -  Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart, and I live and I die by Everything that I say and everything that I do And everything that I make is what I believe to be true And if that shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense I don't give a fuck - cause that was my stream of conscience And that's the way I felt at that time And feelings was the only facts And Racism and materialism is killing blacks And one more thing, if I can ask - One more thing if I can ask - Cause in this life our life just moves too fast And time is something you will never get back What's your quality of life? What's your quality of life? And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight I hope you have a good time tonight...  LONDON!

Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen... and Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume. But I just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left. And everything's been so homogenized. And it's all Big Business, and there's no creativity. When really we have the ability to have a union Utopia if we just help each other, if we just use our resources and stop trying to compete against each other and Beat each other and Eat each other And maybe come together and try to teach each other and Reach each other and Maybe try to come together and love each other Love each other and Love one another, man The way you love your mother, man The way you should love her, man  Y'already understand Cause this is our shit And this is our clique Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique I said ain't nobody fresher than MY MOTHERFUCKIN' CLIQUE!",28,22,23,8,29,38,54,15,12,34,0.5801

I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most  You know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?  I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true  Cause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. [?] I find [?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!  I ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering  Cause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming  I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool.

I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martin's because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design.

I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on this  I’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared.  I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared.

I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own it  You know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius  ’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth  You watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we had  And being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star  But what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time  And the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can  So I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?  But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a fool My boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?  I’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like that  So what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized  So if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper  ’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit up  But you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”  And right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?  And what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s show  But he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?  But I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Mark's, and we gon’ take ’em from the street  And I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…  Hold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now!

Over 21 Grammys. 6 consecutive number 1 albums. One of the most impactful voices to ever grab a microphone. One of the most talented producers to ever produce music, fashion, art. One of the most prolific people to ever speak on behalf of his thoughts, to trigger emotions and trigger thought of you. One of the most clever people to ever manipulate the internet. I watched him go from:  'Sway you gotta hear my rhymes, man. You gotta hear my rhymes. I know I make beats, but you gotta hear my rhymes'  ...being on the train, Amtrak train going to Philly, to now being mentioned alongside the President of the United States, more than once. We talk about President Obama, but you forget some of the things that this man has said to really go against the grain and challenge thought, fearlessly. For example:  : ""George Bush doesn't care about black people.""  ""And another thing is, people so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing, like with the internet — every day, somebody's- ""Ooh I can tell he gay now!"" you know? But back in the day, people used to have songs like ""Get In That Ass"" or something like that.""  ""Remind me again, who's the original Super Fly? And I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie.""  : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here on Shade 45: the one, the only, the incomparable, Kanye West!  (applause)  : That was a nice intro, Sway  : Absolutely!  : That came off the top of the head. That's the homie, what else can I do?  : I don't even have to say anything, interview over. That's all, that's it  : Good to see you man! First and foremost, it's good to see you. I had a chance to go and see the Yeezus tour for the first time. I could not miss this tour with A Tribe Called Quest opening up at Madison Square Garden  First of all, I really appreciate when artists like yourself put spotlight  on artists that influenced you. You know, artists that you grew up with, tuned in to, listening to, and that gave you inspiration like Tribe Called Quest. Is that why you put them on the bill?  : Yeah, I mean that's one of my biggest inspirations. Q-Tip is like my hero. MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS, ""Electric Relaxation,"" uh, uh, LOW END THEORY... a lot of the melodies that particularly Q-Tip — the type of chords they would sample, and that Pete Rock would sample, or like that were sampled on 93 'TIL INFINITY, which I felt was influenced by Tribe mostly... was, you know, what I was going for when I did THE COLLEGE DROPOUT. Or when I always felt  I was at my highest level was when I was closest to like, Tribe records. So, a record like ""Heard 'Em Say"" was a accomplishment for me, to have something that even sounded close to what they did  : You know, I heard you speaking about other producers that are from that era, and I love when that happens, because I don't think we value our history a lot. You know, someone's going to speak on you. They already have started speaking on you. You've influenced a generation of artists who are now becoming more introverted, but more outspoken. Uh, more in tune with the different dimensions of what it is to be a person. Not just, you know, your persona, but speaking emotionally as well  I heard you speak on Diamond D before, another classic producer. And then you also got Showbiz, from the Diggin' in the Crates Crew. What can you say about producers like Showbiz and Diamond D, and how they influenced you?  : I mean, it was just, every time something new dropped, whether it was like SOUL CLAP or you know, just Diamond D being the best producer on the mic. And just, you know, me having these guys to look up to. And hearing the way their music sounded, and knowing that, you know, I didn't really have enough money to buy the records that were needed to create a sound to the level of what The Beatnuts were creating, and what Diamond D was creating  And you know, you go through that a lot of times in your life, where exactly what you want to make, you might not have the exact resources for it at that time. Where No I.D. was the one dude that I knew that had all those drums in his basement, now Eric Schmidt is one of the guys that I know that has what I need in order to keep creating what I need to make DONDA the next— the best way I can say it is the post-internet Disney. But, it's more like Willy Wonka. Whatever idea I have, I want to bring it into fruition  Willy Wonka didn't stop making chocolate because he was making other things. People wanna marginalize me from the top all the way to the bottom. Or, who's to say who's at the top or the bottom, you know what I'm saying? But it's people who just want to hear the music that are like, ""don't work on nothing else because we love your music so much, so don't do that."" And there's people at the top that are like, ""look, just perform at my... son's bar mitzvah, don't do that.""  And what Dr. King said about racism was: even if you don't perform a racist act, if you turn your head to it, that's a form of racism  : That's a form of racism  : So, as powerful as that is, is the way I'm trying to simplify and repeat to the public, to everyone involved, that that is what they are doing to me now. Because my demo tape is that Yeezus tour. So if you take that Yeezus tour, and you meet with Disney, or you meet with Zuckerberg, or you meet with Eric Schmidt, don't tell me I haven't written out the right plan for it. It's 20,000 people, 4 nights in a row looking at pure creativity  So if I say I got a film idea, the Yeezus tour is more of a film or Broadway or a play idea than it is a concert idea. Watch the Throne was a rap concert idea. I like working with Jay, because I can particularly get into the zone of high-level rap, and we brought that neo-Run DMC, you know, niggas in leather, luxe, chains, and everything, to the highest level. Now you see the NFL uses that same thing, bringing Tom Brady up on a cube, right? But would the NFL invest in DONDA to just come up with the ideas in the first place?  Like, before there was even a Willow or the concept of it — basically, it's like if you ever saw Semi-Pro, and how like Will Ferrell was trying to start a new league? You know, DONDA is like the NBA of creativity. Willow is the guy who used to work for DONDA that now designs Jay's tours, Rihanna's tours, Justin's tours. But he's still one of my best friends, and one of my biggest inspirations, and also found a lot of the guys that work at DONDA currently, like Matt Williams who created Been Trill, and also had discovered Lady Gaga, put Gaga with Nick Knight and everything  So, right now, y'all watching almost a comedy of life right now. If you go see Semipro and see how this man was trying to get people to come to the show, he was the coach of the team, he'd have to play on the team sometimes. And that's what it is, it's like, where would Michael Jordan be with no NBA?  : Can I ask you a question? I have to cut you off, um, that sound familiar!  What I got from— one of the things, if you go to Yeezus, if you go see this tour, which I encourage everyone to see because I've watched concerts my entire career, and I've never had an experience quite like that. Every song was it's own story, you know. On stage, it was— nothing was the same and you were totally committed to it. You even— when the lights were dim, you would call out in the middle of the song, ""Yo! The lights are too dim,"" or ""They're too bright!"" When it was too much smoke around the mountain, ""Yo, there's too much smoke! They can't get their Instagram pictures.""  It was really fascinating to see you so in control of this whole experience. When I heard you tell a story about Lenny Kravitz trying to break into the world of fashion and Louis Vuitton and these guys giving you a shot, and Pharrell. And then turning their backs on you. In that  particular field, would you say that part of fashion, the fashion world is racist?  : Uh, I'd say classist and controlist. It's not racist, because they love Asians, you know, so it's not racism. It's more like who can they control? I mean, a guy that was sent to me from Puma literally came to me and said, ""How can we control you?"" But you can't control me, I'm gonna bring positivity to the world. You know, I'm Christian, I'm about to be married, I got a family, I'm not trying to do nothing but good. But Imma rattle that cage until you let me do it  Like, I was interviewing with Charlemagne and he kept on coming up with these old slave concepts of like, you know, ""How you gonna work with the corporations, but you gonna dis the corporations?"" I'm saying, I'm just turn— I wanna be recognized! You don't think, like, half of Drake's songs was coming at me to the point where I had to show up on that stage with him? And then he's like, ""Okay, now you see me."" And that's exactly what I'm doing, I'm like, man, y'all gon' SEE. ME. Y'all not gonna act like you don't see me because it's 50 paparazzi following me. So no like, Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair, no—  it's no powers that could be that are on the internet, that control magazines, that control media, that can stop the movement. It's—  : What I don't— like, I  had Buckshot from Duck Down here yesterday. He has a new sneaker called Triple Threat, and he couldn't break into the sneaker world, so he found his own partners, they got their own manufacturing. They starting to take it from the— they gonna start from the bottom and work they way up. You're Kanye West. All that stuff you said about Marc Jacobs and those guys and H&M stealing ideas...  : Well, I was giving props to Marc Jacobs for actually letting 2 niggas in. And the thing is, he let 1 nigga in but he's the nice guy, that's Pharrell. He let another nigga in that almost lost his life, so I'm living in the afterlife, as far as I'm concerned. I'm living in the second life. I got heaven on earth right now, and Imma make sure that I find my joy, and I don't care about the stipulations of brands or names. People always talking about brands and names; I'm just talking about simplifying things, you know?  Eve made Adam bite the apple, and ever since then it's been illegal to be naked. I'm just trying to help people with they opinion on the law. I've had some clothing mishaps, I've had some clothing triumphs and stuff like that. But I know that I'm— the next Ralph, to say the least! Like, people are combinations of what they were in the past. So that means, of course I'm a combination of Martin and Malcolm, but I'm also a combination of Lenny and Michael, but I'm also a combination of Disney and this— we all combi— in the future, people will be absorbing all of what was, you know?  Think about what the iPhone is currently, you woulda had to have 30 different things in your house to do what a iPhone does in 1. So, for people to say the idea that Kanye West should only do music, it's ridiculous! Like, people told me I shouldn't do music back when I was in art school!  : I'm sorry, I know our time is limited and I don't see you, so...  : No, I'll give you a little bit more time  : Man, I appreciate that, man! You gave me time, you gave me my first TV, it's all coming together  (laughter)  : ""I gave Sway his first TV.""  (laughter)  : Like, you just never had a TV ever before in your life!  (laughter)  : That was classic though, man, that was classic. Uh, but why is it that you need these people? Like you said, you don't need anybody to do these things. You don't need Adidas if you want to do a new shoe  : Yes, you do  : Why?  : Because you need proper production to bring something that has a certain value. I mean, put it like this: like, if I want to get this uh, Japanese-level thermal, right, at a better price to you, if I'm starting small, I'm not gonna be able to get the best price, and I'm gonna be losing money to the point where I can't afford it. I went $13 million in debt working on my clothing line and I'm getting Kanye West-ed constantly with the prices, everywhere I go. So that means, that if someone got less money than me, they charging me a bunch more, because they look at me as the money. That's something they do— they take these celebrities, and they show you this fabulous life of non-billionaires  (Kanye stutters)... I'm talking about, it's— maybe it's like 20 hot celebrities a year; it's 1,470 billionaires. Those 20 hot celebrities, if they were billionaires, they could make sure they're celebrities forever. But they be outta there—  they get the wrong hit, they get in trouble, they do this, they lose this contract, blah blah blah, they outta control, all that...  One thing— I was out in Italy, even right now, uh, trying to start my own company. The type of people that work with musicians... for the most part it's VERY difficult to get high-end, respected fashion people to work with someone that's considered to be a musician. It's very hard to get the good people. Because tell me this— if someone was a fashion designer and came to Dr. Dre, would Dr. Dre produce for them? It's hard! It's just as hard as it was bringing Mos Def to the studio with Jay-Z. Now it's like, and—  that's what THE COLLEGE DROPOUT was, it was the combination of those things  But, let's thank Adidas for giving me the opportunity, it wasn't that Nike didn't uh, you know, offer me a contract. It still was extremely marginalized and a slap in my face, you know what I'm saying? Because they let me design, you know, it's like, yeah, they did me a favor by letting me design, but they let other people ... they let Pharrell design, they let Eminem design, I just designed the Yeezys. I turnt up, where they didn't think I could turn up that far. And they tried to hold it back!  It was like, it was like that moment, you know, when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of ""Monster"" because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip-Hop album of all time, or arguably top 10 albums of all time, right? And I would do all that work, 8 months of work on DARK FANTASY, and people, to this day will say to me, ""Aw, my favorite thing is Nicki Minaj verse!""  So if I let me ego get the best of me, instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform and become all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment  So what happens when Mark Parker's riding on his jet? When somebody come up to him and say, ""My son's favorite shoes is the Yeezy."" Now they could've been working on the Flyknit for 5 years, and working on this project, blah blah— but what I was doing, was so disruptive, as disruptive as that Nicki Minaj ""Monster"" verse was, is how disruptive the Yeezys were. People hadn't felt that feeling since the Jordans. And by the way— the Jordans, only popular at this point because of two people: me and Don C. Because Don C was ordering them vintage Jordans when the 4s used to break apart, on the sole? And we was wearing them—  back when I was wearing the Louis Vuitton backpack with the polos? And they, Jordan looked at, the brand Jordan looked at us and said, ""Oh man, we gotta start retro-ing them."" Because when you think of Jordans, what you think of? You don't even know what the new Jordans look like. All you think about is them retros  : What's going to happen with the Red Octobers?  : You know Nike told me when I asked them? ""We ain't sure."" You know what they told the store though, of my— of my boy that run a store? They said ""if y'all want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes."" So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October— but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. Imma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in DONDA. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes  But if you guys that are investing in the arts, y'all want to invest in this school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I'm standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol! I. Am. The number one most impactful artist of our generation! I am Shakespeare, in the flesh! Walt Disney. Nike. Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more? Or do you wanna marginalize me 'til I'm out of my moment?  : But why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?  : How, Sway!?  : Take a few steps back, to go—  : You ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye) You ain't got the answers!  You ain't got the answers, Sway! (Kanye) I been doing this more than you! (Doing what more than me?) You ain't got— (C'mon, chill out, bro!) You ain't got the answers! (Kanye, relax!) You ain't got the answers! (Bro, rela— I'm asking you a question!) You ain't been doing the education. (Bro!) You ain't been doing the education! (Kanye, calm down!) You don't have the answers though. (Calm down!) Because you trying to give me advice about something- (No! No no no no, listen) You ain't- You ain't got the answers! You ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!  : Kanye, you're absolutely right, but I've spent hundreds of thousands putting out clothing lines at a smaller degree. All I'm asking you—  : And it ain't no Ralph, though! It ain't Ralph level  : Okay well let me ask you this, I'm asking—  : What's the name of your clothing line? We don't know, you know what I'm saying?  : Kanye! Because I lost money, but that's not—  : Exactly, and I could lose money on a higher level, too! Don't think just because— (And that's what I'm asking you— ) Don't think just because I got the most, or the least money (Wait, hold up, let me finish my question, dog) Man be— no, man! (Or hear the question, man) You don't have the answers—  : I'm asking you for the answer, it's a question! Why is it that you can't? You have money, you have—  : I just told you, I lost the money because I did not have the knowledge of how to do it the right way—  : Okay, so you don't have money. So you don't have the money to do it! That's your answer! You ain't gotta turn up, man. This ain't no fucking... show, man. I'm talking to you as a homie!  : It ain't no homie, man, because— the thing is, the bottom line is— (Man, all I'm saying... ) Everybody, every— (you ain't gotta turn up like— ) All you— (You ain't gotta— Hold, hold up! Ay man, listen bro) Ain't no hold up! (It don't gotta be no hold up! I'm asking you a question!) Ain't no hold up! (I'm asking you a question!) Ain't no hold up!  : What you mean ""it ain't no hold up""? Man, we here talking as civilized people. I'm trying to understand your world, because when I go to your concert, I'm curious about what you're saying! I don't know! That's why I'm asking you the questions  : Well Imma explain to you what it is  : Ok, but you ain't gotta turn up on me, man to man, dog? Fuck these mics, we could turn all this shit off, you ain't gotta do this, it's cool. I love you, bro. But you ain't gotta turn up. Ain't no— don't try to embarrass us  : I'm not trying to embarrass y'all, what I'm tryna say to y'all is: this industry, of what I'm trying to get into, ain't nobody never broke down! Ain't nobody broke down! We all slaves! So I ain't tryna disrespect you and your show. We all slaves to something—  : It ain't about my show, 'Ye—  : I ain't tryna disrespect you, period! Let me talk, if you gonna have me talk. We all slaves! We all slaves! And y'all ain't experience nothing right here but a moment from a movie out of Glory. Back in the day, if slaves had enough money they could buy they own freedom. We all slaves— we slaves to Nike, we slaves to Benz, we slaves to public perception. We slaves to not looking, you know, what somebody gonna say after the interview: ""Why you let Kanye do that? you should've checked him.""  : I don't give a—  : I love you man, I'm sorry! I love you man, I'm sorry, ok?  : Ok, that's fine, that's fine  : But look at this, this exactly what would happen at the French Revolution, this exactly what happened— I'm sure there's some arguments with Harriet Tubman and other people, talking about ""Let's go this way,"" ""Let's go that way."" But what I'm trying to say is: I sat in Paris. And met with these people. I invested my own money. And lost money. I made T-shirts that made money! I made music that made money. But at the end of the day, Lucian Grainge still cut my music checks  As powerful as my voice is, Lucian still runs 50 percent of the music industry. François Pinault owns Balenciaga, Puma, St. Laurent, Stella McCartney. François  Arnault owns Louis Vuitton, um, Céline, Givenchy. Renzo Rosso owns Margiela, Diesel, Marni, Viktor & Rolf. These guys got factories! These guys have factories. They run that!  The thing— the thing that compresses me is time versus money. Integrity, money, and relevance. Because, as I work on clothing more, I'm not rapping as much. So I'm not in the middle of that Future mix because I ain't do that feature. I'm not rapping as much, I'm not having as much finances. I'm losing relevancy. The relevancy is part of my power that allows my brand to be big. That's what I'm saying, you juggle so crazy!  But then you get a Nike, that could simply say: ""The Yeezys did good, that was a good job. Let me get you some more so you can start your own line, because obviously people lining up for it."" But they'll marginalize you, and play you, and talk about, ""We don't even know when the Red Octobers coming out."" You see what I'm saying? I'm juggling a lot of things at the same time. You know what I'm saying like, y'all putting me number 6 after Big Sean on the Hip-Hop list!  : Man, do you really give a—  : My— no, what I'm saying is, my relevancy— that means because, because I'm wearing a kilt or because I'm doing something that's game-y...  : Naw, that ain't why you was number 6. At the time we did the show—  : What you think now, though? What you think now?  : If we did it now, you would be number 1! You or Drake, it would be between your or Drake who would be number 1. That's what I say now. Who would you think would be number 1? Out of you and Drake?  : Drake?  : Drake  : Yeah  : That's what I think now. At the time we did the list, you had the CRUEL SUMMER album, and you had the ""Mercy"" song, you didn't have ""New Slaves"" out  : I don't care about the list—  : But I do! Because you've been going around discrediting the list. And the people who do the list, there's not another collective of people in this business that know more about Hip-Hop. These are the same people who said you were number 1 years ago!  : No, it's fine, the list is fine. But what I'm trying to say is when you trying to keep up with the list, and write all these raps, but you also trying to learn about clothing. You got a whole hood calling you a fag for even liking clothes, for being at like, uh the runway shows. Like you can't be a masculine person like Ralph Lauren, and still love the beauty and texture of clothing, as a artist. And still love a fat ass at the same time. You know?  Then you got America, the president, constantly attacking you. Then you got people over-charging you at all times. Then you got your constant public perception being brought down. AEG telling you when you go on tour, when you can't tour. Everybody got opinion towards you. You got shoes like the Nikes selling at eighty thousand dollars, and the the head won't even get on the phone with you. You got a meeting where every single door gets closed on you, like the Will Smith movie with his son, it's like that. It's like that, but me! But me, because I'm in that Michael Jackson position where he couldn't get his video played on MTV because he was considered to be ""urban.""  : So...what is your plan—  : And sidebar, you gotta get in— you gotta...Charlemagne wanted this so bad! He wanted me to turn up so bad, I wouldn't even look at him. See, I can turn up around you because I love you, as my brother, we got history. Me and Charlemagne, we turn up, we don't know what— we don't know where that's gonna go. I know that we gonna hug it out, everything is cool  : Yeah yeah, we're good money. But we haven't talked in a while and so— and what you go through...by the way, I am always in your corner. And you're, you're right. You're in a realm where we don't know, people don't know what you're experiencing. Man, all these fucking names you naming sound foreign to me, bro. Because we don't know. But we need you to explain it, if I ask you a question man you can't blow up on it. I'm trying to understand why can't you? I don't understand. Now I do. I don't understand why you need these people to get your music out, you got the internet. You king of the internet. When you did your uh, GOOD Fridays, that was fucking— nobody did nothing like that. Why you need those people is what I don't understand. But you explained it to me. That's a fair question. Let's talk about your music real quick, though. Alright...  : Yes, boy, my drink is running out, too, Sway, goodness  : First of all, the YEEZUS album is incredible to me. You know, there's a lot of messaging that I like. Sonically, it was different. It reminded me of a time we were on the road talking to veterans and I asked you about music, and you said ""I don't use sounds."" I said, ""How you pickin' your sounds?"" You said, ""I don't see music as sounds, I see it as colors."" You know, so when  listen to your music, that's what I do. I see it as colors  Two things: I'm curious to why Pusha T and Big Sean weren't on this tour, with the GOOD Music artists. Why did you decide not to put them on the tour?  : Well, every artist that makes good music, is on GOOD Music. Drake on GOOD Music. Wayne on GOOD Music. James Blake on GOOD Music, Frank Ocean on GOOD Music. You make good music, you on GOOD Music in my mind. I'm not marginalized by the brand of the deal that I've taken from Universal in order to cut some of my homeboys some checks so that we can, you know, work on creative projects together. I'm not marginalized by the branding concept of GOOD Music versus Cash Money. All I do text Baby like, ""Yo we need to do something together."" You know what I'm sayin'? We not each other's enemies  And everybody got to get they own, you know, maybe it's just a piano that I'm bringing for John Legend, executive produced that. Maybe it's a art package that I do for Pusha, or beg him to take like, a certain song off that I think sound too commercial. You know, because we didn't quite get to that with Big Sean on some of the songs that I wanted to take off and stuff. And it upset me as a Hip-Hop artist a bit. And now he gonna turn up on this next one and we talked it out and everything, and that's what it's gonna be  But I think that, for me, I serve as an inspiration. We do go hard, I feel like ""Started from the Bottom"" now we here is Drake rapping harder because we pushing harder. We pushing each other like, when Jadakiss and Styles was spitting, we had to push each other  And what I'm establishing with YEEZUS is, you know, to take that stance, and I put my whole family on my back and I say ""Fuck the radio,"" as that number one most important artist of our generation to say that. And, I'm saying ""Fuck the radio"" not saying I don't want to be played on the radio. But it's just saying stop making songs for the radio, make songs for the people! And then some people could say ""Well, man I don't feel like YEEZUS was for the people. I don't feel like blah blah blah."" Or make songs for yourself, you know what I'm saying? Because for me, I like ""On Sight."" I like all the songs, that's the shit that's enjoyable for me to listen to after I'm—  Because when I was in Paris, man, I worked on that album— my mama nicknamed me Mandela when I was a shorty.  I wanted to burn those buildings down... it's a misconception that I said ""Boycott Louis Vuitton."" You can't boy— I wouldn't say— I wouldn't tell nobody to boycott a brand that ain't nobody even thinking about no more! Nobody thinking about buying Louis Vuitton! That brand old! You know what I'm saying? Nobody thinking about that brand, I wouldn't say boycott that brand!  I'm talking about some relevancy. But I wanted to go in and turn— and let me tell you something else that's so Hip-Hop. The music and the clothing are just as important! That's what make you Hip-Hop! You show people that you Hip-Hop by what you wear. So if I was able to be considered a person that wasn't *allowed* to be Hip-Hop, wasn't allowed to be a rapper, and I went and turned around and became the most important, not rapper, but artist of the past 10 years?! That's exactly what Imma do  And I'm gonna be the first, straight, Hip-Hop, loud, celebrity, non-etiquette having, black out all the time, fresh-ass, super tasteful designer! Of all time! Imma be the 2Pac of clothing! You can't be a bigger music superstar than Michael Jackson. You can't be a bigger basketball star than Michael Jordan. You can't be a bigger rapper than 2Pac. But it's a space, and it's product territory, to Steve Jobs that all the way  : Can I? Okay, and I respect that, and I think that's what makes you great. That's what makes you an inspiration— you're fearless, ok? And we need that in Hip-Hop. I've seen that with 'Pac, I see that with you, I've seen that with Jay. I see that with Drake, in the way he makes his music. People critique him, but he going through similar things you went through. But he's fearless. But at the end of the day, too, at the core of all this, what made me like you in the first place? Is that you're talented, and you know how to rap well. So, all this shit started with rap, bro. And my second question is...  : Uh, that's your opinion. That's not my opinion  : For me. I'm talking about for me  : I started from my mama, now I'm here. I started with when my mama was educating me since...  : No Kanye, you missed the term. I'm talking about. I didn't know you when you was born  (laughter)  : Sway, you crazy  : You used to come up to MTV, it was your talent that you as a producer. Your mind wasn't where you are, you ain't the same person today that you were when we met  : Yes I was, yes I am  : You a lot more mature, and you a father now. You're not the same person  : Yeah, in a way, but I've been the same person since age zero. I was born to be me  : Ok, ok. Hey man, can you do a rap for us? Can you rap for us, bro?! Can I get a verse?  : I ain't got no new verse  : You ain't got no new verse?  : I ain't got no new verse  : Man, last time we talked, you came off the top of the head. Let's take it back to the basics, man  : Ok  : Alright, let's do it. Fuck it. Kanye West. Sway in the Morning. Shade 45. Wonder, what you got?  (DJ Wonder starts playing beats)  : This is...?  : You don't want that one? You'd be the last person to pick a beat, man  (laughter)  : Shit, we gonna be here til tomorrow  (music)  : Oh I like Nine Inch Nails...  (music)  So what you uh...?  : What you talking about, man  : Just put it in rap form?  : Yeah, talk about what you talked about. Talk about them names, these corporations, this marginalization  : I can make shit rhyme I can make shit rhyme if I'm Feel like, even if I, don't So I just, might not Cause I don't want And I'm just gon' freestyle, for the first time With a, freestyle, that don't, even go together, oh!  No rhymes, that's my new shit, nothing rhyme How that sound, uh oh! Wop! You ain't got the answers, Sway I can say it all, night  : That's it: You ain't got the answers, Sway! Wait, hold up! I started the year off with ""I gave Sway his first TV.""  : Now what is it?  : I gotta end the year off with ""You ain't got the answers, Sway!""  : Hashtag it!  : Oh man, you've been making me have a great year, bro. Thank you, man. That's a wrap? That's what you gonna leave us with?  : Yeah, that was the first freestyle that had absolutely no rhymes  : That's what you gonna leave us with, right?  : Yeah  : That's it, huh?  : Yeah  (laughter)  : That's...word?  : That's it  : That's it, huh? What about a written?  : No  : No? But you still love to rap though?  : I do  : Okay, cool man. Hey, listen brother, check this out man. It's always good to see you  : Alright, hug it out, bro! (sound of mics muffling as Kanye and Sway hug)  : Good luck on your plight. And whatever you need from us, get at us, man. Alright? And ni-nigga, check this out. I don't use the word nigga, I'm not a ""nigga"" user. Don't yell at me again on the mic, alright?  : Alright, look man. No disrespect. I love you— I love you Sway  : I love you, too  : I didn't mean to turn up at your show, man  [Sway (Woman 2)}: I don't— it's life, baby. This ain't— I ain't the fucking— Don't marginalize me to just this show, man! (Yeah, Sway!) Don't do that to me, man! Alright, this is life, but I love you man. Kanye West, ladies and—  : Cus you know we'll argue and we get it out anyway— us, anyway man. That's how we talk  : Yeah yeah, that's true, man.

Especially that song “Drug Dealer” You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour; People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through You know, and people are human They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high) So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth; You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it... That they try to bring their kids to school... That they try to make a difference.""   ""Next message.""",9,12,3,4,16,9,27,3,5,15,0.9816
