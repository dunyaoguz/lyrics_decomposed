I'd do a lot more offshore fishin' I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken Take a few strokes off my golf game If I'd have never known your name I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova I probably never would have heard of yoga Be a better football fan But if I was a single man Alone and out there on the loose Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""  I could tell that got her attention So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I wouldn't trade a single day For 100 years the other way."" She just smiled and rolled her eyes, Cause she's heard all of my lines I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously If I hadn't been so lucky  I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad Playing bass in my cover band Restocking up cold Bud Light For poker every Tuesday night Yeah I'd have a dirtbike in the shed And not one throw pillow on the bed I'd keep my cash in a coffee can But if I was a single man Alone and out there on the loose Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""  She knows what a mess I'd be if I didn't have her here But to be sure I whispered in her ear  ""You know I get sick deep-sea fishin' And you make the best fried chicken I got a hopeless golf game I love the sound of your name I might miss that old green 'Nova But I love watchin' you do yoga I'd take a gold band on my hand Over being a single man Cause honestly I don't know what I'd do If I'd never met a woman like you.""",0.9949,1,2,2,5,8,6,19,4,2,9
