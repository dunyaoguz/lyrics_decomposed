I saw a dude named Hogman, The Intruder, no, I just made that up, but it's it's not the worst rap name I've heard at all, man  Here's some tips if you rappers wanna be more professional: First of all, stop rappin' over your own vocals at your concert. Clear your goddamn instrumental and rap over it, I don't wanna hear you rappin' over your raps, muthafuckas. Also, stop have thirty five people on stage - who are these people?! Are you travelin' with these people or did you hire them locally? Did you pay for their travel? Get all of those muthafuckas off of the stage. It's confusing. I don't like it. You can't do that at other jobs. You can't be an accountant like ""Hey I'm about to do your taxes, here's my thirty friends just standin' around doing nothing while I do your taxes""; fuck outta here  Also, stop talkin' 'bout the same shit. I don't think you have a fresh take on havin' money. I'm tired of hearing about it, I don't, I don't think it's interesting. These muthafuckas need to mix it up. I think I've heard every perspective on havin' money or I used to have money and I oh I got money, I didn't have money, I got more money than you'll ever get, I never thought I would get this much money, I had money now I'm getting more money. Stop getting soo many chains. You don't need that many chains - you only need one chain. Or if you're 2 Chainz, you can have two chains, but not more than that",-0.9951,16,13,6,3,13,12,27,3,11,23

Well, because you're gonna get up and perform, honey   Yeah, I mean...   You need, you just, I guess I just think you're underestimating...  Stewart: LD's Dad And not only are you gonna perform, you're gonna perform 3 shows in 4 nights   Yeah   You know, you don't wanna get sick. You don't wanna have a cold, you don't, you know I'm trying not to be a Jewish mother, here, but I think you're really underestimating this   No, you guys are handling it, I'd say you're playing your role great as the, the Jewish parents of a rapper I'm curious to hear the conversations that happen between other rappers and their parents, I think these are interesting   What do you mean by that, David?   What do you mean what do I mean by that?   When you say we're handling our role, you think we're being, uh, we're being sarcastic?   No, I-I enjoy it, I think it's funny. I'm just saying, like, I can't imagine, like Puff Daddy or something talking to his mom and she's telling him, like 'You better get a good night's sleep, you can't catch a cold.'   I-I, you know what, actually, you're gonna laugh at me. I disagree with you, I think anybody's mother would do that   Ok   And when Puff Daddy was 25 years old and the night before he was performing I'm sure somebody was telling him the same thing. That's what mothers do Black, white, Indian, it doesn't matter who we are   I respect that   But Jewish mothers a little more   Yeah, Jewish mothers maybe a tad more",0.9946,1,11,1,0,12,10,18,7,5,16

JEAN: The question is whether the clubs will allow it DAVE: Uh, I probably only would get strippers for Philadelphia JEAN: Well, you're breaking up again DAVE: I said, I probably would only get strippers for Philadelphia STEWART: But, but, a practical question in organization is, do they allow it? DAVE: Yeah... STEWART: Someone could research that for you. That's another detail DAVE: Yeah, why don't you take care of that detail for me? Figure out what venues allow strippers. Is that something you guys could handle or no? JEAN: No. 'Cause I don't know what venues... You would have to ask William Morris or whoever's, you know, booking this stuff to find out for you. We can't find that out DAVE: Well, if like I give you, if I give you the venue name and number, you guys could call JEAN: (Talking to Stewart) You could do that STEWART: I, yeah, I'll call...

You can call me Dogg Let me just check your sheet No problem, sir, let me just say I’m a big fan of the shit that y’all make I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave, let me start with your background Where you come from? Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond Before that Oh, you talking 'bout my hometown? Yeah I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap Elaborate Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that When you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps Boo-hoo what a hardship How you paid to get the rap shit started? Man, my Bar Mitzvah money But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose Ha, look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass Yeah, I guess That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap? Oh my god, it’s the best Bitches let me draw up on their breasts Literally, I can reinvent myself I get a forum to project myself It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself It’s kinda healthy Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals Sure In a club and a couple niggas threaten you Uh, I wouldn’t do shit And I don’t even get what that got to do with this? Shut the fuck up, rap's like life If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch Nah, that’s my niche! Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed That’s the target I’ll hit And that’s the heart of my pitch I wanna do this whole thing different What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different? Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right? Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know You don’t know if it could be working even better And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out I don’t mean any disrespect by that I’m just saying I have a different background Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant  [Verse 2: Lil Dicky & Snoop Dogg] So what are your biggest strengths? Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer All right, all right, I get it Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever (Go) Got a long bottom bitch, call the hoe Neville (Whoa) And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh) You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat Bro, I can go on and on I’m taking over and they mad like father-in-laws OK enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different than the other guys Well I don’t know if they can run it like that But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap What’s that? Well I can tell a story about my morning Watching Boy Meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence Like the 14 year old Topanga Oh this shit like a joke to you? I don’t get it Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual Like, as a guy So when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie Real recognize real, right? Yeah, I guess... so what you tryna do Five years from now, tell me 'bout the dude Well, I don’t care about the money Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate I don’t wanna leave the game the same In a nutshell, what’s your legacy? Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand-up rap Put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was anti-rap Yet, the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left That shit sound pretty damn complex I guess, I wanna be the best I just wanna do it my way And turn the whole game sideways And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight I ain’t mad at that Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack Just let me in and I’ma rap the plaques And I ain’t about to win them back to back I’m 'bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back Til I stop rapping You ain’t even sold a damn album yet True That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet Let alone a young rook nigga You misread me Nah this ain’t a book nigga Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg No, you just fucking repetitive dawg I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddar's involved I get that I gotta prove myself No shit you ain’t done shit Think about that though Only doing this a couple of years One tape and I’m like this? This shit is aight for your first shit But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit You don’t think finding out would be worth it? It might be, it might not But I’ma put your ass to work, kid Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really? Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together What would you do for the hook for this song? You want me to make a hook up right now? Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself? All right, uh, okay Man do the hook! I’m 'bout to be professional Homie, I’m professional Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing? Nigga, that shit is garbage man Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes? Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing Whatever man, you trying to smoke a blunt? Right now? Yeah Sure  [Outro: Lil Dicky, Snoop Dogg & (Juanita)] Dope. Juanita, bring some weed in here, please. Thank you (You got it, Snoop. I’ll be right there.) Thanks, Juanita. Super nice woman Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft? Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so… Whatever. Thanks (Hey, I got y’all y’all weed.)

I don't know what to feel, everything has gotten totally real Everything I always wanted right in front of me with nobody near So it's weird that I'm overly scared, but I'm so unprepared Holding a beer, I'm witholding the fear Not in the clear but I'm kind of revered And yeah I might appear like the chill type The veneer's not real in the real-life What it feel like? Thanksgiving I was missing, I ain't even miss 'em Girlfriend hella distant, I ain't even listen Only shit I really care about is spittin writtens This is the beginning I'm just getting into the game My world's not spinning the same The shit looking like it's bigger than Dave It's so crazy But when all this sit in the stake I can't brake Even if I'm afraid it might change me   Baby if you let me You know I could get deep Baby hope you ready I'm coming through Running you That's what I do Just know that it's all for you So what you gonna choose? Afraid to say OK   And I know I'm not gonna get in the way But I'm afraid Who I want to be is what I became But I'm ashamed Ain't no coming back Facing what I wanted But it's all fucking weird And now I'm really scared   I ain't made from the projects But you know I treat the game like a project So you know it's not the same kind of progress Different process, but I digress Other rappers didn't blow overnight They ain't have a 9-5 that was totally ripe They was all up on the grind from the moment they write At 25, hadn't even done a show in my life It's like - ""Damn, I'm a rapper, how did that happen?"" I was making ass then back when Only used to rapping to my Mac then pack then Views came through, like ""Shoot, let's practice"" Trying to tell you I'm not bred for this shit Despite that, feeling like I'm meant for this shit But like that, everything depends on this shit? And I ain't betting against it But I ain't had a moment to reflect what I'm betting against it I'm next even though it's pretentious, I sense it Relentless, but it leave me defenseless I guess I should learn to accept it but it's hectic Oh, you want a condensed list? I'm worried that I'm about to give my all to it, 100% You ain't got to know it all to discover what's left Pretty fucking intense And I'm worried that I got a lot of gall when it comes to success Telling y'all that it's 100% But what happens if I fall short of what I call the surest of bets? Cause what's 100%? What's 100% is that it'll take a lot to make me content And I'm about to chase around a legend that I fucking invented While I'm neglecting everybody that I love and respected Because I hate the thought of coming in second And I don't want to do no second guessing when it comes to progressing Because I really couldn't stomach regretting my effort When I'm at the end and I'm assessing if I could have done better I better be able to be it than never, or be the best ever But if somehow I'm really that special then I'm about to deal with mad pressure I fear that when I finish my assessment I'mma be in depression Because I'll see a lot of me is regressing It's obvious to me that to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself I wonder what I'll see in reflections? I wonder if I'll run into a woman, cool, but come in second Or if I'm bound to be the fool at the weddings Alone and regretting the whole thing Now you're seeing why it's so big What would y'all do if y'all were the old me? Get involved and you gotta give the whole thing This is no fling, this devoting Every mother fucking part of yourself No matter whatever the cards you was dealt You going all in I don't know about y'all, but I'm gone And I don't know if I'm balling or bawling   If you let me You know I could get deep Baby  hope you ready I'm coming through Running you That's what I do Just know that it's all for you So what you gonna choose? Afraid to say OK   And I know I'm not gonna get in the way But I'm afraid Who I want to be is what I became But I'm ashamed Ain't no coming back Facing what I wanted But it's all fucking weird And now I'm really scared",0.9767,18,19,22,19,20,49,35,20,9,22
