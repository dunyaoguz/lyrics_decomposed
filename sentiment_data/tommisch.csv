But for how long... With you my colors raged, but for how long? For how long? For how long... With you, I am harbor With you there was no distance For how long? But for how long... With you we drew no lines With you there was no divide But for how long? For how long?   Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we know But love's so hard to hold... Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we know But love's so hard to hold...  With you I rest, but for how long? For how long? For how long... With you I've loved, but how love goes? How love goes? How it goes... With you I built a tower With you it stretched to the sun But how it crumbles? How it's gone... With you my voice would carry and drift on through the air But how it falters, when you're not there...    You held me close As I fell through your arms And you held me close (Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...) As I fell through your arms (Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...) And you held me close (Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...) As I fell through your arms (Fell through your arms, I fell through your arms--)  ",0,16,0,3,5,14,7,13,3,2,0.6498
