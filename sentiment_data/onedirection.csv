With that in mind, here are just a few of the greatest teen pop bands ever  The Beatles  Arguably the most famous of them all, The Beatles rose to fame in the early 1960’s, originating from Liverpool, England. The four-piece band (John Lennon, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), went on to sell an estimated 800 million records worldwide. The band were known for their innovative style and music as well as their extraordinary popularity, dubbed ‘Beatlemania’. Many musicians to this day cite The Beatles as their main influence as well as classing the band as the originators of pop/rock music, helping pave the way for artists. Also, millions visit Liverpool every year to see landmarks made famous by the band such as The Cavern Club, where the band first started out playing music  The Spice Girls  The Spice Girls were a girl group who burst onto the music scene in 1996 with their debut single Wannabe which topped the charts across the globe. With a string of top 10 hits worldwide as well as selling over 75 million records, the group were unstoppable, enforcing their message of ‘girl power’ wherever they went. Known mainly by their nicknames (Ginger, Baby, Sporty, Posh and Scary), millions of teenagers looked up to them as their idols, buying into the pop phenomenon. To date, The Spice Girls are regarded as the best selling female pop group of all time  ABBA  The four-piece Swedish pop group were formed in 1972 and went on to achieve worldwide success and stardom almost instantly. With hits like Mamma Mia, Dancing Queen and Waterloo, it’s clear to see how the band got so popular with millions of fans across the globe. The groups success has seen them sell over 140-500 million records worldwide as well as earning themselves a place in the prestigious Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Although the band disbanded in 1982, their timeless music lives on with new generation of fans tuning into their iconic catchy hits  One Direction  The five-piece British boyband shot to fame as part of being contestants on The X Factor UK back in 2010. After placing third in the competition, the band went on to achieve global success, hitting number one across the world including on the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut album Up all Night. The band attracted millions of teenage fans as well as performing sell out stadium tours. The band also sold bucket loads of merchandise ranging from branded pens and pencils to personalized headphones. A lot of merchandise for pop bands sell online as well as other musical products, ensuring you can look for some of the best gifts for kids, whether it be for their birthday or other special occasions  Whilst these are just a few examples, there are many more successful pop groups, armed with catchy and infectious songs that have gone on to sell millions of records worldwide",0.9964,8,11,2,4,16,18,37,9,12,8
