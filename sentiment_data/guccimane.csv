I enjoy working out molding my body and I look forward to changing my diet for the better because I realize to get to the status I crave I must make a life-change which is permanent not a quick-fix  I can see myself now at the top of my game, me and my beautiful lady walking the red carpet at the best parties and getting flooded with accolades at the award shows and setting trends that will be copied around the world. This is not a dream though this is a plan that I will affect directly.

I was proud of the work I put in and the quality of the project but I was angry that someone had to be killed over a dispute about the rights to some of the contents of the album. 10 years later I reflect on how that day impacted my life and my legacy and I am grateful for all the fans that supported me then and still support me now. Every challenge and obstacle in my life has helped me to become who I am today and provided me with the tests to display my resilience. I hope my life showed someone somewhere that if you endure the storm you will eventually get your chance to shine. I never give up and I have grown and learned so much and still am eager to learn more. I look forward to showing the world how much I have grown and getting out and helping my community. I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a recording artist and help others get their chance to be heard. To my fans I love you all and I want you all to know I am motivated and will not let my past decide my future. I chose to not focus my attention on my negativities but on my dreams. I will keep on hurdling and keep on hustling. My liabilties I turn to assets and even my inconsistincies make me the unique person I am. I am focused and I will be returning soon very soon so get ready. If I had to change anything in the last 10 years I would not change one thing. Sincerely Guwop!
