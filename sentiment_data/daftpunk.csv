And I didn't have any idea what to do But I knew I needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track Which then was synced to the Moog Modular I knew that could be a sound of the future But I didn't realize how much the impact would be My name is Giovanni Giorgio But everybody calls me Giorgio     Once you free your mind about a concept of Harmony and of music being ""correct"" You can do whatever you want So, nobody told me what to do And there was no preconception of what to do",0.785,0,6,1,1,7,3,9,7,3,5
