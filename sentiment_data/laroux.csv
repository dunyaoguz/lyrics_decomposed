And I've been tryna find my way to the shallows But the water's just too deep Always somethin' inside of me Keeps draggin' me down I'm going deep below the undertow And it won't let go All I need is silence   There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence And he creeps in through the walls at night when When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad All I need is silence   All I need is silence Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me I need silence   So tired of breathin' in numbers Tryin' to stop my racing heart All I know is that I want it to stop But I don't know where to start You're always on my shoulder Prayin' I won't try anymore And conversations that begin to shout Are you happy now? All I need is silence All I need is silence   There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence And he creeps in through the walls at night when When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad All I need is silence   All I need is silence Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me I need silence All I need is silence Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me I need silence   There's a thumping that's- Si-Silence All I need is silence   All I need is silence Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me I need silence   There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence And he creeps in through the walls at night when When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad All I need is silence   All I need is silence Oh, I'm cryin' out for silence You're not my partner, no you're not a part of me I need silence   There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence And he creeps in through the walls at night when When I can't see, happy from sad, good or bad All I need is silence   Silence Trying to stop my racing heart There's a thumpin' that's filled with Trying to stop my racing heart There's a thumpin' that's filled with violence Silence",-0.9979,10,10,4,10,9,15,16,10,6,11
