Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes In the upper downtown, wherever it was The people around you, the things around you Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book God called you a prophet When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out And it commands attention, it commands change I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you And in the midst when you're, starting to understand That I caught the wrong message, and now it's time I'm hearing from God, what amazing experience, as you hear from God He said, ""Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation"" Old things are passed away, somebody needs to hear that and behold Everything becomes new, and when everything becomes new in you It's time to stop the killing I said it's time to stop the stealing It's time to stop disrespecting our women It's time for us to come home and raise our children It's time for us, to really mould our communities It's time for us, not to get hooked up in religion But to get hooked up in relationship, with God And the amazing thing about it Is wherever you find yourself right now, you can confess And you can tell God ""I'm sorry; I had the wrong cue, I was doing the wrong thing I was going after things that I thought were right, but it wasn't right And now that I'm getting it right, I'm asking you to forgive me And I may have done the things, that they said I did But I'm not, who they say I am; I am who you made me to be And I'm changing in that, and it takes a few moments But every time I fall down, I'll get right back up And every time I make a wrong turn, I'll get myself back in line Because I recognize, I have been called, for such a time as this!"" You can't resist the change And you're not condemned by your yesterday If you can grab hold of your now, and move in your destiny Move, change, and be, now!

Security! Come get these niggas!   + (Snoop) Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach Ready to relax, kick up my feet Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?) Oh, nothing just called, looking for some women how can fondle my balls (Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back) Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed Put one up in the air, the cops just stared Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care Got to the tele and I slid through the door On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor And what would happen next only time could tell Cuz I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Aaah!

So being in the depths of solitude, if you ask me Is were the true heroes of our times stay 2Pac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever Rest In Peace, live in harmony...

Just like a crowd in a stadium, mills I be craving them Money making schemes locked up in my cranium Cause I need out of this critical situation My mind's in jail, I don't know the time that it's facing Cause I'm   I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place Bad luck is what results from my paper chase I keep looking but it ain't no goals So I don't wanna look no mo', what I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place Bad luck is what results from my paper chase I keep looking but it ain't no goals So I don't wanna look no mo', what   I'm sick of knocking, I'm sick of clocking I'm sick of dropping in a hole, never reaching my goal It's got my soul separated into pieces, it just increases I'm hit with anger like a cook's hit with hot greases So if you understood my attitude Maybe you'd feel what I'm feeling And it'd start appealing To your intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations Death by temptations, even got my heart pacing So I'm tracing a line where I can find a better path And make it last, sit back and laugh before the aftermath The tragic flaw is what makes it raw So let it thaw and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl My way, I see the sun and there's no delay I'ma pray, cause the Lord'll make a brighter day Or will he keep me in this holding cell? But enough with the questions, the only story to tell is that I'm   I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place Bad luck is what results from my paper chase I keep looking but it ain't no goals So I don't wanna look no mo', what I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place Bad luck is what results from my paper chase I keep looking but it ain't no goals So I don't wanna look no mo', what",30,35,26,25,22,58,50,28,24,24,-0.9947

Here we go, here we go Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now   Check it! You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself With all models I make I'm great like five lakes You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past ""Word of Mouf,"" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass  [Verse 2: 4-Ize] These rap cats is soft like R&B singers It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean I rip meanface niggas one by one Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade You want the tail in the back or, a light fade? Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes The black rolls with the dozen attack flows I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace",16,5,10,16,9,27,17,8,5,10,-0.9664
