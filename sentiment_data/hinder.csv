Here I go, again There's my phone, again My head's pounding I'm coming down from another round out on the town again Hand on the clock, ticking The hotel room, spinning There's a guy on a cross hanging up on the walls Saying it's my fault, the devil's grinning   Same shit, every day Set in my ways I'm out of control again Like someone cut the brakes Burning all of my time You're asking why? But I'm not listening cause it's my wasted life  Whoa, whoa, whoa...   Dead-end job, fuck it My asshole boss can suck it Cause it ain't worth all the pennies I've earned Just another drop in the bucket   Same shit, every day Set in my ways I'm out of control again Like someone cut the brakes Burning all of my time You're asking why? But I'm not listening cause it's my wasted life  Whoa, whoa, whoa...   Same shit, every day Set in my ways I'm out of control again... Burning all of my time You're asking why? But I'm not listening cause it's my wasted life  Whoa, whoa, whoa...  It's my way... It's my, it's my wasted life It's my, it's my wasted life It's my, it's my wasted life",13,6,12,3,0,15,2,4,0,0,-0.9945

Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?   And I'm still closing down these streets I'm high enough to make believe That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground The one that got away from me Every now and then she calls to see If I'm alive or plan to settle down Well, I called her drunk last night And I think I heard her say   What ya gonna do When the whiskey ain't working no more? Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?   I can't sleep and I can't hide 'Cause the voices in my head are getting louder Getting louder every night I'm living life with no regrets They're on their way but ain't here yet   What ya gonna do When the whiskey ain't working no more? Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?  What ya gonna do When the whiskey ain't working no more? Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more?
