How does someone do so right if only seein' so wrong? How does a community change for the better to change another community? The answer is one word, self. You see you must first change yourself as a person before you can change someone else or correct anyone on their own problems. Only he without sin has the right to judge someone with sins in their wrong heart. Some people are good hearted, some people are bad hearted. Good and bad people both have their differences but one thing they have in common is sleep. You see no matter how long you stay awake, you will always need to sleep. And in that sleep, you exist in another world, another realm. You will wake up in the morning only to have to go to sleep that same night. And then you exist again in the dream world.
