Thank you! :)  And I just want to take a, take a little poll here. Don’t worry about it, it’s not gonna offend me, I just wanna know, how many of you here tonight in the audience don’t know who Joanne is? Oh. I think many people are a bit lost But, if you do know who Joanne is, that’s amazing And for those of you wondering tonight, you might be saying, who’s Joanne? *laughs* And that person, Joanne, is two things. Number 1, my middle name is Joanne, given to me by my parents But Joanne, was also the name of my father’s sister who I was named after. She died in 1974 of lupus This loss of my family, it travelled decades and generations that I thought she would be like an angel, from the dinner table I thought of her and my parents at night, and I study her, so that I might be able to understand my father So when I asked of all of you tonight, it’s even the joyest moment that we get to spend all together, knowing I know And many of you know that there are people all over the world they could never afford to go see a live show like this, you are all so very lucky And as we got time to ask you, I would ask you to honor your own pain in this moment, and take yourself back to that place where you were blasted and your life was changed so much So much that you don’t even remember who you were before  For me, that pain has only one name, and it’s Joanne  *whispers* one, two, three *plays guitar*  Take my hand, stay Joanne Heaven’s not ready for you…  Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl? Girl, where do you think you’re going! Girl   We both know, things don’t work that way I promised I, wouldn’t say goodbye, so I grin, and my voice gets thin  Girl, where do you think you’re going?  Honestly I know where you’re going  And I’ll still love you even if I can’t see you anymore. Can’t wait to see you soar  Joanne middle stop speech: Hello gentlemen I guess what I’m trying to say is I was trying to figure out myself a little better, and, instead of just staring at myself I tried to figure out my dad, and my mom, and their pain. And it led me right back home  *sits* *whispers* one, two, three  *plays guitar*  Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going girl! Girl, where do you think you’re going, where do you think you’re going, going, gi-oh-rl!

And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality  For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring  Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam  The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears  ""The Prelude Pathétique""- Last Part: You may say ""I lost everything"". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again",8,3,5,5,3,9,10,6,0,9,-0.8806
