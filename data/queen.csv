Don't you hear me calling you? Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand In the land that our grandchildren knew   In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue The volunteers came home that day And they bring good news of a world so newly born Though their hearts so heavily weigh For the Earth is old and grey, little darlin', wellaway But my love, this cannot be For so many years are gone though I'm older but a year Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me   Don't you hear my call though you're many years away? Don't you hear me calling you? Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand In the land that our grandchildren knew   Don't you hear my call though you're many years away? Don't you hear me calling you? All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand For my life, still ahead, pity me"

Another hero, another mindless crime Behind the curtain, in the pantomime Hold the line Does anybody want to take it anymore?   The show must go on The show must go on, yeah Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flaking But my smile, still, stays on   Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on Does anybody know what we are living for? I guess I'm learning I must be warmer now I'll soon be turning, round the corner now Outside the dawn is breaking But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free   The show must go on The show must go on Inside my heart is breaking My makeup may be flaking But my smile, still, stays on   My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die I can fly, my friends   The show must go on The show must go on I'll face it with a grin I'm never giving in On with the show   I'll top the bill I'll overkill I have to find the will to carry on On with the show Show must go on Show must go on"
