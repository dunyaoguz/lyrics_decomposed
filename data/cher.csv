She dealt two cards, a queen and a three And mumbled some words that were so strange to me And then she turned up a two-eyed jack My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black She said, ""The man you love is secretly true To someone else who is very close to you! My advice is that you leave this place Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!""

So I ran home and crawled in my bed I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said Then I remembered her strange perfume And how I smelled it once in my own room So I snuck back and caught her with my man; Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand... The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor-- Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

Look at the headlines Big crowd at the crazy house Long queue for the Joker's shoes Ten rounds in the ring with love Do you lose and win or win and lose? Sweet rain like mercy in the night (Lay me down, wash away the sorrow) Caress my soul and set it right (Lay me down, show me your tomorrow) Summer tears, winter and the moment's flown Don't you sometimes wish your heart was made of stone?  Mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone Get the picture: no room for the innocent Peak season in Lonely Town Knocked out of the ring by love Are you down and up or up and down? I asked the river for a sign (In my dreams we go on together) How long is love supposed to shine? (In my dreams diamonds are forever) But you and I - we hurt together, hurt alone Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?

I've been driven by perfection But nothin's perfect when love ain't right Nothin's perfect when love ain't right...  Oh, perfection You drive me crazy with perfection I've worn my pride as my protection I'm goin' crazy with perfection  All my life I've been driven by perfection Pushed it to the limit every day and night Whoa...
