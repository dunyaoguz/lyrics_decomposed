I’ve talked about this before. Rap is done. Rap is done. I love Hip Hop. I love rap, but the thing it was supposed to do it doesn’t do anymore. Like I love it as a music. It’s the same thing as like jazz. Jazz when it was doing what it was supposed to do. And people still listen to jazz now, but it doesn’t have—It’s not doing the social work it’s supposed to do anymore. And that’s not because it’s gotten bad…It’s just a different movement. Whatever movement is happening now—Like I would like to think I’m a leader of whatever movement is happening. People call it ‘new black.’ People call it whatever, but I don’t want to name it cause it’s bs to name it. As soon as it gets named that’s when you start marketing it. And it’s like ‘Ah, this is hipster.’ Cause hipster was cool until it became hipster...And then it became monetized. Same thing with Hip Hop. So, whatever this thing is. Whatever’s happening. Like whenever Jaden Smith tells me he’s like ‘I’m real excited for whatever’s happening.’ He can feel it. I can feel it.”  Later in the interview, the Stone Mountain, Georgia singer/rapper discussed the lack of “a sense of balance” between races and also addressed crooked cops  “That’s the thing,” he said. “People feel like that’s an attack on something. It’s like ‘I get it. I understand. You guys are in charge. You don’t want to lose the power. I totally get it’…I’m not hating on that. I totally understand. I get it. I’m just saying there’s got to be a sense of balance. Same thing with cops. It’s like ‘I get it. You’re putting your lives in danger also. But what am I supposed to do when a cop who’s a bad person does something? Who am I supposed to tell? I would call you guys, but at the same time I know what’s gonna happen.’”  Gambino also addressed a controversial poem he penned last month following the shooting death of 18-year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the poem, he states “I wanna be a white rapper.”  According to the singer/rapper, he wrote the poem, which he says was “about freedom,” while he was “in the moment.”  “That poem was about freedom,” Gambino said. “It really was. It was about freedom. That’s what I wrote and I—People were upset. But yeah, good. A poem should make you . Like when was the last time someone wrote a poem that made you feel bad like crazy? That was heart. That’s how I felt in the moment…I just wanted to write about—I wanted to show how freedom is something that’s so great when you feel it. Like I felt it. I feel it on stage…I don’t hardly remember when I’m on stage most of the time. Cause it’s like freedom.”  Video of Childish Gambino’s interview with Peter Rosenberg can be found below (via 2DopeBoyz)"

That’s you And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me You’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying anything all summer Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me And choosing to do so again the next day and so on A girl who’s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet  Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood We won’t go to the same high school So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop That looks like a kid we know And then I’m like, “Can I tell you something?” And all of a sudden I’m telling you And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming And your face is there and gone and there and gone As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway And there’s no expression on it And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny” I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay” I don’t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long, I really am  I wake up, the bus isn’t moving anymore The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on I turn and you’re not there Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore We’re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now Your bags and things piled high in the trunk The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus Just as one of them reaches my row It used to be our row, on our way off It’s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week After throwing rocks at my head Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise She stops and looks down at me And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can’t really see her face But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny” Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh And then she turns and leads them off the bus I didn’t know you were friends with them  I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over So is summer, even though there’s two weeks until school starts This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not I’m just saying it’s what I learned I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus I still haven’t"

Trying to find  again after the big bang. Every soul looking for each other like every drop of water looks for the Ocean  The rules of the Internet are the rules of our new universal language like the Bible, like the Constitution, we make rules to break later and be better. Pushing forward until we are all just a bodiless conscious, buzzing through the air trading information, conversing, testing ideas without fear or violence. Free from limit. This is the moment we decide if we want to be the kid pouring salt on a worker’s head at the sit in, or the kids sitting calmly in the face of what everyone else identifies as futility  … Or we can be the kid sitting back, just trying to eat. Ignoring what’s happening in front of them. Not having an opinion until the acceptable choice is handed to you by people you don’t know  We have reached a moment where there is no “real” because we don’t care anymore we can curate what’s real every day our timeline or feed. The boundary of what’s real and what we want to be real is as volatile as the worth of our bitcoin or human heartbeat  This is an important moment  But beware that we are all making it up as we go.

I don't know Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care? Living real everyday, what was your undoing? Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him (Eww) Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?
