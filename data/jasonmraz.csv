Is it long enough for me? Long enough for me to chew on If it isn't... if it isn't .. if it ain't if it don't if it can't then it won' And that's just the way that it goes"

You're not blaming me for anything, well that's great But I don't break that easy Does it fade away?   So that's why I'm apologizing now For telling you I thought that we could make it I just don't get enough to believe that We've both changed   When all along the fault's been up for grabs Why can't you have it well it's for sale go make your offer I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero   Well neither one of us deserves the blame Because opportunities moved us away And it's not an easy thing to learn to play A game that's made for two that's you and me The rules remain a mystery See it's hardly easy   When all along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it Well it's for sale, go make your offer I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero, Lord, Lord"

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one? I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin' I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin' I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin' Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin' Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin' Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin' Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son? Who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman whose body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded with hatred And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son? Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one? I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin' I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison Where the executioner's face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin' But I'll know my song well before I start singin' And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall"

Because I (cause I what?) Because I appreciate the mentality of music I'm saving all my sentences unless of course I'm smoothly spoken The Quiet type--the kind to watch out for No man of the clan, I'm perpetrating the scam--  Sure. I'm the boy with the Fallopian voice Straight from the sleeve of any wizard of choice I got the reason to be roaming out the coverage area; Send me the bill if all my loving is scaring ya Dare you to dream the way that I believe-- Got the skill to go commando in any fatigues I got the best damn band in the music scene But I can also flow solo or just let it be  Because of the love Oh, your self-realization is your if, and, and but But you got to know your name before the play of the game Keep a level-headed check on your health and stay sane Adjust the tack on the track, the needle's on the record, prepared for playback  Sajak, could I buy another vowel? I need another clue and I could also use a towel And how goes the medium tempo Slaying all the teachers like the class of '84 And down low you know my fidelity's go But I would never hurt a fly with my flip-flops on  I Got control I keep a clean toilet bowl-- 2000 flushes blue and still going strong Do I do what I do for the sake of the song Coming through on the radio?

And don't it feel so nice. Lovely   Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again  And don't it feel alright. And don't it feel so nice. Lovely   Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it And don't it feel alright. And don't it feel so nice Lovely   Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. To do it again Again. Loving again. It's coming again Lovely"

Pass the analytical knife   Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate   Believe it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box My stomachs smaller than my eyes So I went to see the doctor and he said ""turn your head and then cough"" I didn't listen to what he said instead I couldn't wait to get off He said I can have this but I can't have that That I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because I ain't the one whose gonna be missing the feast Just like you ain't the one who seems to be calming the beast    Well if you are what you eat in my case I'll be sweet so come and get some I'm so over it   Now you're about to get cut up or get cut down It's all about the know how all just a matter of taste Stop telling me the way I gotta play.

And everybody's hypnotized by the dancing light  Tv sets making everybody go blind  And I can see thru you  And when I look inside I know..  That you are living in a fantasy world taking your time, running your mind on low  And you are living in a fantasy land holding nobody's hand but your own  I said, ""I can see everything""  One drop of rain that's me and all the rest is you  Who shook these trees? Let me guess did they come in two's?  When you're dealing with the fruits of the universe  You shake that apple tree, life deals you an orange, either way you're cursed  Oh the bitter water, satiated, covered in salt  Keeping me afloat, and always moving me along  It's keeping me on top of the water  Keeping me on top of the world  Keeping me on top I'm looking out  Just to see what everything is all about  And I know where it is..

They were romancing They were falling in love all over Falling in love all over again Yes, they fall in love Connecting the dots and crawling around this galaxy From town to town, look what I found Falling in love Look what I found Falling in love again All my friends falling in love all over <i>The darkest space:</i> I'm not just a song anymore I might be the whole damn score I might be reeling in your head while You're sleeping in your bed at night I'm not just along anymore Well I finally found what I was lookin' for I might be sitting in the passenger's side but not along for the ride Cause I've got control of a home grown situation I lay back and then I turn the alarm off and turn out the light There's going to be some quality sleeping Quality's keeping quality up at night I am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly Through the darkest space Where I try to catch up to a catch phrase To human race I say let the games begin Under way still in conditions that we play in Maybe these things are better this way May the games begin today Oh well I'm just above Any ailing aggravation of love And I raise to optimistical fortune Toasting it twice I'm getting high on an anytime any day night And I laugh to think I'm crying my eyes out well isn't it nice It's the darkest space Where I try to catch up to the catch phrase Human race I say let the games begin Under way still in conditions that we play in Maybe these things, maybe these things May the games begin in open space I finally catch up to a catch phrase To human race, well I say, honey let the games begin Under way still in conditions that we play Maybe these things should begin today Boy, this whole damn world is your toy, boy  Thank you.

Talking about our house is on the front porch Telling jokes and they swing swiftly towards happier times Expending lines and finding more energy for the effort  And getting distance from that front porch spotlight But us we found peace in shadows Long enough to see a monster die We all need to find a little space in our daydreams  Long enough and just so long Long enough, just as long, just so long Ss its long enough is it long enough? Is it long enough for me? Long enough for me to chew on  If it isn't, if it isn't, if it ain't, if it don't, if it can't, then it won't And that's just the way that it goes"
