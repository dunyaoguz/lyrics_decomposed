Talkin' to myself but I never listened Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it And I fall   I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type Yeah, for your type Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?

So I passed her a light She's trapped in her mind, until she opened her eyes, eyes and recognise a real nigga Out where to start, drive the fancy cars, live the fast life, name in bright lights, name in bright lights Take a gamble, what do you want? Something particular Sip of Ciroc making you hot, shaking the atmosphere, yeah Big as a dance floor, let her know my flow, oh she wants the bright lights   All that she want, to see the bright lights in Vegas Smoke 'til she's painless, she asked and I gave it How can I deny?
