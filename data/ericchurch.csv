I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder But you kept me from goin' under When that current got too heavy I always thought I'd be a heap of metal In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy Fear, I've had none What the hell made you wanna love A man who was gonna die young   Call it intuition, or call it crazy Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies But I'll gladly stick around if we're together So baby, when you bow your head tonight Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind? And with you I'd like to live forever"
