I'd like to express my extreme point of view I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew I'm just living out the American dream And I just realized that nothing Is what it seems   Do I have to change my name?

Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll And can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow?   Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues   I was a lonely teenage bronking buck With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck But I knew that I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing   Bye, bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singing this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die   I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away Well, I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play   Well now, in the streets the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire the most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died We started singing   Bye, bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singing this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Bye, bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee But the levee was dry And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye Singing this'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die   We started singing We started singing We started singing We started singing"

I recieved your letter in NY but I had to leave for Mich, which is where I am right now. I have thought long and hard about what I want to do with our songs, my record, the sound, the vibe etc. I had always intended to do a portion of the record with Nellie Hooper because I like the sound of all of his records and I think he has really good instincts. Then I thought about doing the rest of the record with you not really thinking what the divide would be. This is where my head was at when I left Miami. Then I started thinking about how I didn't want a record that sounds like two different producers worked on it. I allready had that nightmare experience. Then i started leaning towards Nellie doing the whole thing because he's not a song writer and I thought he would treat all songs fairly without favortism and ego involved. I sent all my demos to Nellie to listen to and while he gave it up to a few he made some disturbing remarks about how he was going to have to change the music so much he would want a writers credit. Which of course made me sick. EGO-EGO-EGO!!!! When I was in NY I had to meet with William Orbit which has you know we're trying to do a deal with and he played me more tracks that blew my mind and I mentioned that I would like to write with him and he said he had studio time and why not tomorrow? To make a long story short we ended up doing several tracks together that I absolutely adore and more importantly I love his sound. Suddenly i felt like he knew what direction I wanted to go musically (sonically). I haven't formally asked him to produce my album but I'm going to and I wanted you to know first. I know he will be gobsmacked and humble and eager to please which is not to say that you aren't but I really feel strongly about taking a new direction and William's sound is a complete departure. After making so many records it's what I need to get my blood boiling. I hope you will not be insulted or take offense by this decision. I loved working with you again. You're a brilliant musician/songwriter and I have the utmost respect for you. On top of all that I adore you. You did say you were cool with any decision I made. Obviously if we use any of your programs you will be compensated. I may use a rough vocal or two and I haven't decided if I will use all the songs we wrote. I will keep you posted on everything. I will probably be working all of July and August and September. In any case these are my thoughts for now. I'll be in LA on Monday if you want to write or call  Take care  Love  Madonna"

And if you like two, you might as well have four And if you like four, why not a few? Why not a slew? (More! More!)  If you've got a little, why not a lot? Add and bit and it'll get to be an oodle Every jot and tittle adds to the pot Soon you've got the kit as well as the caboodle (More! More!)  Never say when, never stop at plenty If it's gonna rain, let it pour Happy with ten, happier with twenty If you like a penny Wouldn't you like many Much more?  Or does that sound too greedy? That's not greed, no, indeedy That's just stocking the store Got to fill your cupboard Remember Mother Hubbard (More! More!)  Each possession you possess Helps your spirits to soar That's what's soothing about excess Never settle for something less Something's better than nothing, yes! But nothing's better than more, more more (Except all, all, all) Except all, all, all Except once you have it all (have it all) You may find all else above (find all else above) That though things are bliss There's one thing you miss, and that's More!

Turn a blind eye Try to pretend that nothing is what it seems Torn between the impulse to stay Or running away from all this madness   Who am I to decide what should be done? If this is the end, then let it come Let it come, let it rain, rain all over me Like the tide, let it flow Let it wash all over me, over me Let it wash all over me, over me Let it wash all over me   All of my illusions Could be shattered, in a second You can thread a needle With a teardrop from my eyes It's a cruel injustice to be witness to the things I see Looking for the answer When it's right in front of me   From the Tower of Babylon Where nothing is what it seems Gonna watch the sun going down I'm not gonna run from all this sadness   Who am I to decide what should be done? If this is the end then let it come Let it come, let it rain Rain all over me Like the tide, let it flow Let it wash all over me Who am I to decide what should be done? If this is the end then let it come Let it come, let it rain Rain all over me Like the tide, let it flow Let it wash all over me, over me Let it wash all over me, over me Let it wash all over me"
