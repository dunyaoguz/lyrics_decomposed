We'll say, No man But you can do the job When you're in town  Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland  In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he's a circus clown We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman Until the other kids knock him down  When it snows, ain't it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland  We'll be walking We'll be talking In a winter wonderland"
