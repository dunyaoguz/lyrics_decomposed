So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone   A child is born On this holy night And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright So come to see Mary's sweet baby And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully So peacefully Oh yeah"
