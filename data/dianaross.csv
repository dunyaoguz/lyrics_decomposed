I'd just be rising to fall  Love was easy to believe in When you wanted me yesterday But I couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow  After you What am I gonna be? You took a part of me As you were passing through  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  Drifting again From place to place without reason Season to season I just keep running away  And as for people again I'm just a girl who discovers Now and then lovers Who never ask me to stay  Love was easy to believe in When I walked in the light of you Now I'm walking by myself And all I see is darkness  After you What am I gonna be? You took a part of me As you were passing through  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  Raining again I ought to get out from under Sometimes I wonder Sometimes I don't wonder at all  After you How am I gonna find The me I left behind That I'll meet after you  After you What am I gonna be You took a part of me As you were passing through  Raining again Raining again Raining again  After you What am I gonna be Raining again

""Pippin"" is the story of Emperor Charlemaine's son who could never ever find hapiness. He tried everything. He tried war, he tried religion. And he even tried a little sex. But it didn't work. Too bad for him! The song I'd like to do for you know is from ""Pippin"". And it's about his search for fulfillment to find his corner of the sky  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Gotta find my corner of the sky  Everything has a season Everything has its time Show me a reason And I'll show you a rhyme Cat's been on the window sill Children fit in snow Why do I feel I don't fit in Any place I go  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Gotta find my corner of the sky  Every man has his day dream Every man has hit goal People like the way dreams Have of sticking to the soul Thunder clouds have their lightning Nightingales have their soul Can't you see I want my life To be something more than long  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Gotta find my corner of the sky  So many men are destined To settle for something small Don't you know that I won't rest Until you know I had it all So don't ask where I'm going Just listen when I'm gone And far away you'll hear me singing Softly to the dawn  Rivers belong where they can ramble Eagles belong where they can fly I've got to be where my spirit can run free Gotta find my corner Gotta find my corner Gotta find my corner of the sky Sky"
