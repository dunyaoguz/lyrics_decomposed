What will they do? When they see how I can't live without you Without you...  There'll be no white flags Up in the air tonight I won't surrender ever no Not this time And I won't cry, I won't shed a tear Just as long as you're standing near,oh my dear But now you're gone And I am left alone But your face is all That I will ever know No I won't cry, I won't shed a tear Not one single tear, just as long as you're standing near Oh my dear, but now you're gone, gone gone, gone gone Now you're gone, gone gone.."
