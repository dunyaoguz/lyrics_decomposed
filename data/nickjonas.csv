Believe, believe, believe  I don't need rose-tinted spectacles Just to see the fundamentals I Only see the bright lights The sunset and the sunrise And if it is weak then it's Wrong And just when it's right then it's wrong And everything your eyes See Is nothing like it should be  And yes it's all frustrating when no one else sees Everything you see So for now it is just an illusion, confusion Unless you're someone who believes  When you look, tell me, what do you see? Is it real or a mystery, scientifically? It's more than just a bench in a park Look again, it's a rocket that's headed for Mars On a mission to search for the life When it'll be back, who knows?
