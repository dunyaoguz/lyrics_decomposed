Under the stars and stripes We live and die with our friends There's nothing we can't do As soon as the sun sets I'm gonna find me a girl I'm gonna try and make her laugh And once she gives me that look I'm gonna take her hand 'Cause everything about her reminds me Of all the broken romance behind me I'm giving love another chance to find me On these American nights!  Days like these don't come up any higher We've got main street lit up like a fire Nothing compares to breathing the air When I'm back in my hometown Someday my kids will run like I did On these streets and old playgrounds!  I wanna drive all night Turn up the radio loud Love's hanging in the breeze I shut the whole world out So come and ride with me baby I'm saving you the front seat baby Feeling nothing but free baby On these American nights!  On these American nights!
