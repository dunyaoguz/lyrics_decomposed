See when it's true love there will be some bitterness, yeah  Now you're so distant I know I'm not the women that I was But you are not the man you were, oh  But if you say you love me When it's good enough, you're still in love You shouldn't even shake your world  Yeah, we disagree, fuss and fight We get it wrong more than it's right Yeah, we make mistakes and fix mistakes We're never even seein' eye to eye  But when the dust clears and settles And it's all said and done When the night breaks and day finally comes  Will you love me in the morning? After the evening, will you leave me? Will you love me in the morning? Now that the sun's up, will you give up?  I know things ain't the way it was to be But it's okay we'll get through this Baby, it's worth it, sometimes we have doubts And love just ain't perfect, so don't give up  Just love me in the morning After the evening, will you leave me? Will you love me in the morning? Now that the sun's up, will you give up?  Will you love me in the morning? Now that the sun's up, will you give up? After the evening, will you leave me? Love me in the morning Now that the sun's up, will you give up?  Don't give up on me, just love me Just love me, just love me"
