I'm floating Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining Plain sailing, no commotion Like a dolphin when it's in motion Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken? No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you Arm for arm, eye for eye I just want to live my life But they don't want to see this guy survive  "

When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free Just locked in a cage slaving They said they were gold in the pavements But you came and saw the road to amazement Broke your heart But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast I hope your listening right I still think of you every Sunday No one can top your chicken and rice Even through the darkness times You held us all up because your vision was bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside You never let anyone see your heartache You just got on with it Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful And your words you would stand strong with it Cause they were like warmth on a winter night But I was just too young to go on with it And there somethings I could try to do But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you  [Hook 1: Ed Sheeran (Dot Rotten)] And of the pieces of my soul (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh   I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now I would be by your side when you needed me Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?"" Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths I miss seeing a family, being a family And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer Family problems have never been funny In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia She took all our inheritance money Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces I never forgive the way she betrayed us There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing But I guess that everyone's different Or should I say no one's perfect? She had happiness in front of her But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing Since you gone the foundations crumbled So building it back up is my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect So give me the strength that I need to perform this task Make it right, I must do And I ask cause I trust you It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you   And of the pieces of my soul (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh   It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but I miss you, oh how I miss you It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but I miss you, oh how I miss you   There ain't enough words to describe How sorry I am for the pain that I caused Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood We were young and he said it was raping his broad And for the day police came to the door I'm sorry for being such a bad youth Stealing from your purse and making you mourn I never been able to say this before Cause I was so inconsiderate You loved me unconditionally And I took advantage of it like a idiot Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I really hope that you can forgive me You going away was a punishment But I won't let go I'm holding you with me But I still fight the emotions within me   I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? And can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face Feel the chill of your warm embrace? And can I say goodbye to you? I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you?

It's D-E-V to the Zed Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying Cause I got too much to stay awake for To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by   I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free It could be The times I'm living in lately   I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)   Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information And then decide what probably is most practical to do Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"" What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"" In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got I keep my pupils engaged Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake  "

I wanna know"" No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped And all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her 13th birthday   And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside For angels to fly For angels to fly Fly, fly For angels to fly To fly, to fly Angels to die"

With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget ninety percent of it when we wake But the other ten percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow IGH!"
