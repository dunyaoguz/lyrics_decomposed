Cause, I wanted Andre 3000 with the whole album I had this play idea, Act I, Act II, Act III And then later on I was like With the visuals I can make it more of a play But theres no way I can make a album out of a play I'm too much of a rager for this shit to be like (sorry, stuff) For Stuff, for stuff to be to that you know I didn't want people to overthink it I didn't want it to look too much so I feel like the Only thing that needed to be complicated was my title People to understand it, and the music straight forward   And thats exactly what it is you could have a party to this album and just let the whole album play   What do you want to listen to?   I want to start with ""the ends"" thats my favorite song even if you skippin' around you gotta start there Travis Scotts taking over the show It's Travis Scott in the morning    [Playing ""Pick Up The Phone""] It's Travis Scott its HOT 97 in the morning   Wait why do you get to talk It's Travis Scott in the morning, let him say it   It's Travis Scott in the morning Hot 97,  Ebro, Rosenberg, Laura Styles lets get it   Ebro I don't know if you realize this Theres probably a pretty good chance, knowing Hot 97 It will be Travis Scott in here at some point and I'll still be sitting in the same seat, its a pretty good chance   I think what happens is they bump you out and keep me, in a order thats the order of operation   Wait, Travis out of all the young artists, you are on what, your third project now, you were one of the artists I gravitated to first just cause I can understand what you're saying I'm just figuring out Young Thug, like I was late to it, but the style of music that you're creating who, who were you inspirations, who did you pattern yourself after, you're 24 now?   I looked up to M.I.A. and Kid Cudi man he's really one of the main dudes I kinda looked at and listened to all the time He saved my life He saved me from doing random bad things to myself Kept me focused like..   Just through his music or personal relationship   Just through his music because I didn't meet him 'til The first time I met Kanye was the first time I ever met him But I didn't really meet no Cudi until like earlier like Late late late last year when he came by the studio one time just to like talk to me   What was it about Cudi's music that spoke to you so much?   I feel like he really dialed in on like, the youth and really dialed in on like, inspiration, how to inspire you His words were very selected, on like what to do I feel like he always made the soundtrack to my life Or anybody's life who was like going through the same thing If you a big Cudi fan you know exactly what I'm sayin' like, he says the exact same things you growing up with But makes it sound way cooler I went through this, I went through that My mom didn't have this, we had to go through this You know we had to go through Christmas to do this But the beats and everything just sounded like You know, the Nutcracker   Do you think, do you think And you were saying off the air too Do you think he gets credit for being a cultural influence?   Nah not at all cause I think, you know Cudi should be like a top tier artist up there man alongside With these other artists who like, are number one, you know I think he fathered a lot of, a lot of the music A lot of style of music   Well, we know what he did for Kanye for sure, like Everybody talks about that   He's a good influence and you know, a good help His writing and his mind He makes beats I don't think people know that He made ""Sky Might Fall"" you know, he made mad beats He made some beats on 808s and heartbreak, he's super dope he can write   Speaking of which, who did the beats on this album, on your record   Vinylz, I always work with Wondagurl on every album Can't do a album without her TM, this kid named dax, Murda, Cardo Its weird though, I only have 4 producers or something like that 4-5 producers   You wrote with and worked with Rihanna You wrote with and worked with Kanye West on several things Some other artists, I don't want to run through the whole thing But what else are you doing besides writing your verses   Well when I first came into the game I made beats Thats what I did, I had to give people my own beats As a artist I lost a lot of lot of lot of time to make beats I wanted to focus on raps because I felt like when I came up here I wasn't the best rapper, I had the best beats I was doing Cruel Summer, I worked on Yeezus With those albums, like by the I got to Jay Z albums I was already having ill songs, so it just turned into me just giving people my songs, you know On 'Ye album or her album, so on I sat and worked with them on the whole album Whether it was for two or three months, picking mad beats Whether its different people beats or, taking out the drums Putting my drums   How do you know how to like craft something for someone else   I always see it, I'ma tell ya'll something about myself I was always making music   You were mimicking other stash   Mimicking other artists, when I was 13-14 years old Making beats and making music just to get the sound, right And so like, I think every producer, any young producer So like when they make like their favorite rapper Made that beat, make the same rap just to understand okay this how they did it   To Understand   Just to understand it completely, okay the breakdown So when I grew up, I was like you gotta translate it to your own songs, so that kinda grew me up like welded me I'm a big fan of people man, a lotta people feel themselves   Thats so important that you say that because Not a lot of people come out and say yo I'm a true fan and I love   Who are you the biggest stan of you've worked with so far, musically   Kid Cudi but But I'mma say, I'mma say, I've been in the studio with Jay-Z dawg And at first I was not that a big of a Jay-Z fan bro But bro, bro, bro bro I don't even know how old this guy is (no one knows) This dude, I've never seen him pick up a pen I seen him do the Magna Carter This dude's freestylin' the whole album, with facts though You know, him and Andre 3000 too though Lotta people be talkin' bout Andre Like why he not dropping music Man that man has information man He know how to play the piano man like Frank Sinatra style, Beethoven style   Do you have information on his new Outcast album   I'm not talking about that man   I tried to get it out   It's Travis Scott takeover, let me bail him out We don't want this to get crazy we want this to go right   What's your favorite Of the songs you've been involved in for other people, whats the one you're most proud of?
