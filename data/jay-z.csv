I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Ohhhhhh  [Verse 3: JAY-Z] And if my children knew I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame ""You did what with who?"" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? ""You risked that for Blue?""

Through all the excitement and joking around (as well as the technical difficulties) I missed out on the opportunity to say something important..  On the show as well were Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson.. I thought that to be the oddest pairing EVER but, soon realized, it’s what I’ve always professed..There is NO such thing as BLACK music or WHITE music only GOOD or BAD music..It’s stupid cool to like things that are not like you, and that goes for outside of music.. If you’re an African American you can have a jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor having some Israeli mixed with his jewish count? (Sure they are paranoid but, so are black people after they’ve smoked weed, haaaaa, and plus the JEW fro and the BLUEprint fro are the SAME thing.)  I think concerts like this should happen more often. ( Outside of the one or 2 festivals a year or “Zootopia”) I’m putting that into the universe..next up Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!!  Sorry I don’t “Tweet” (do I?) so this will have to do..  Love"

And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got em And this was the stress I lived with till I decided To try this rap shit for a living I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made Every sister I played Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody's fault I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me  [Outro: My Chemical Romance & (JAY Z)] (If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black)  When I was a young boy My father took me into the city To see a marching band He said, ""Son, when you grow up Would you be the savior of the broken The beaten and the damned?""

/songs/15,JAY-Z,December 4th,https://genius.com/Jay-z-december-4th-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/15,The Black Album,2003-11-14,"   Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.  [Verse 1: Jay-Z] They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone."" So on that note, I'm leavin' after the song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'Cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted   Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.  [Verse 2: Jay-Z] Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack ""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career 'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!   Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.  [Verse 3: Jay-Z] Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water without work You thirst 'til you die, yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me   If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade..."
/songs/578601,JAY-Z,Decoded: Part 1 (Excerpts),https://genius.com/Jay-z-decoded-part-1-excerpts-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/578601,Decoded (Excerpts),2010-11-10,"Part I My life after childhood has two main stories: the story of the hustler and the story of the rapper, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I was on the streets for more than half of my life from the time I was thirteen years old. People sometimes say that now I'm so far away from that life - now that I've got businesses and Grammys and magazine covers - that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant is the story of your own life ever going to be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were burned into me like a brand. It was life during wartime.On ""Public Service Announcement""  even when a rapper is just rapping about how dope he is, there’s something a little bit deeper going on. It’s like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have a set structure, but also a limited subject matter. They are mostly about love. Talking on such a familiar subject and writing about it in a set structure forced sonnet writers to find every nook and cranny in the subject and challenged them to invent new language for saying old things. It’s the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar subject in the history of rap -- why I'm dope -- and frame it within the sixteen bar structure of a rap verse, synced to the specific rhythm and feel of the track, more than anything it’s a test of creativity and wit. It’s like a metaphor for itself; if you can say how dope you are in a completely original, clever, powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the boast’s truth. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest versesFrom Negative Space section  Hip-hop has always been controversial, and for good reason. When you watch a children's show and they've got a muppet rapping about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. The music is meant to be provocative - which doesn't mean it's necessarily obnoxious, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it's dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily figure out the first time you listen to it. Instead it plants dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that knocks in the club or has witty punch lines the first time you hear it. But great rap retains mystery. It leaves shit rattling around in your head that won't make sense till the fifth or sixth time through. It challenges you  Which is the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem isn't in the rap or the rapper or the culture. The problem is that so many people don't even know how to listen to the music  Since rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can’t just half-listen to a song once and think you’ve got it. Here’s what I mean: A poet’s mission is to make words do more work than they normally do, to make them work on more than one level. For instance, a poet makes words work sonically - as sounds, as music. Hip-hop tracks have traditionally been heavy on the beats, light on melody, but some MCs - Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony, for example - find ways to work melodies into the rapping. Other MCs - think about Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool chief rocka, I don’t drink vodka, but keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don’t mean much, but he snaps those clipped syllables out like drumbeat, bap bap bapbap. It’s as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came away thinking it was a simple rhyme about holding weed in a gym locker, you’d be reading it wrong: The point of those bars is to bang out a rhythmic idea, not to impress you with the literal meaning of the words  But great MCing is not just about filling in the meter of the song with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get at complicated truths in a way that straightforward storytelling fails to do. The word you use can be read a dozen different ways: They can be funny and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be nakedly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is deceptive. It seems so straightforward and personal and real that people read it completely literally, as raw testimony, or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, It’s all white noise to them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run off yelling “See!” and feel vindicated in their narrow conception of what the music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her drop a line about drinking or sleeping with someone’s husband and then dismissing her as an alcoholic adulterer  But I can’t say I’ve ever given much of a fuck about people who hear a curse word and start foaming at the mouth. The Fox News dummies. They wouldn’t know art if it fell on them."

I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic? Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain? Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place? Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal? If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly? Can I still touch lives, answer their ""whats and whys"" Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five? If I should die... don't cry, my niggas"

Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now Just the thought alone fucks with me   High on life I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest   ""Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.""

EVER!""   Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another Baby with no daddy want no momma drama I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us For the beauty that you be Blue be Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears Cheer up, why can't you just be happy Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy Badly I just wanna spent more time with him Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps Cut the cord watch her take her first breath And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared But in life and death if I ain't here   High on life I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest"

I think this rap shit is all beef  [Verse 1: Jay-Z] Y'all don't even know every day I'm living with stress Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless I'm on the dance floor, hot-ass vest You think I'm freaking these chicks, right? I try not to brush against they chest You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped Swear to everything when I leave this earth It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine We'll lose two lives, yours and mines Gimme any amount of time don't let Ms. Carter grieve At the funeral parlor dripping tears on my sleeve Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me And I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars, lucky me   You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me  [Verse 2: Jay-Z] I hate all girls with ulterior motives That's why I'm 20+ years old, no sons, no daughters Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters Hear the hate in my voice, right? I hate that you noticed Niggas wanna strip you to the bone for shit you own Hate a nigga like that, faggot, get your own Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome Knowing one day I'ma have to flip, c'mon You know the shit don't stop 'til the Cris' don't pop And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock I'm trapped, the whole world's against me in fact But ain't no turning back, bring it on Hate the price of fame 'cause it cost too much Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much? Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us Steady looking for flaws through us, lucky me  [Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)] You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me You only know what you see (Since I was 4 years old I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold) You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me (And now that I've arrived I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold)  [Verse 3: Jay-Z] And niggas see you in the street, pretend to be friendly But I know any type of success breeds envy I know in the back of your mind you're conjuring ways to hem me Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up Don't grieve for me, my art remains Like a dart from the speaker to your heart Spiritually through the portal now my words is immortal Don't plan to leave without a fight, I plant a seed I give life Though I can't see past the girl's greed to call her wife Next time you're thinking heist better be precise 'Cause I'm fully prepared, one of us is gon' leave here I have no regrets even though I won't see grow My godson Boogie, Sonny and Remo, lucky me  [Chorus: Karen Anderson (Jay-Z)] You only know what you see (I been told, since I was 4 years old Everything that glitters ain't gold And now that I've arrived) You don't understand what it takes to be me (I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold Since I was 4 years old) You only know what you see (I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold And now that I've arrived) You don't understand what it takes to be me (I see those truths unfold before my eyes in a world so cold) You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me You only know what you see You don't understand what it takes to be me"

Such a good kid,"" got us pourin' Henn' already Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi Till the next time I see her, on the other side He was just some thug that caught some slugs And we loved him 'cause, in him we saw some of us He walked like us, talked like us His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn Poor Isis, that's his mama name Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name? Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him Damn near impossible, only men can raise men He was his own man, not even him can save him He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away Isis' life just ended on that rainy day When she got the news her boy body could be viewed Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew Angel dust, dipped in WOO! She slipped into her own fantasy world Had herself pregnant by a different dude But reality bites and this is her life He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife It was just this night when moon was full And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home Will you still love me after this night? Mike was the hard head from around the way That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life But Isis liked this Broadway life She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight She was so turned on that she had to shower twice How ironic it would be some fight that Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like ""If that was my son, he would look much different See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark"" So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?) Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day He approached this thug that had a mean mug And it looked so familiar that he called him ""Young Cuz"" Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you) Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up) There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord You know what they say about he who hesitates in war (What's that?) He who hesitates is lost He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct Six shots into his kin, out of the gun Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son Six shots into his kin out of the gun Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons   Meet the parents..."

You know so today it’s kind of, it’s kind of, an exchange. You have some way to drop it back off, you know  When art started becoming part of the galleries. There became a separation between culture.

We’re artists we’re alike, we’re cousins, that’s what really exciting for me: bringing the worlds back together  I try not to have any expectations going into a performance.

Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedies Frank Sinatra, having dinner with the Genovese This is the genesis of a nemesis Mother America's not witnessed since The Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses This is the tale of lost innocence As the incense burn and the turntables turn And that Al Green plays I see my mother's afro As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's And my papa just left the house In search of the killer of my Uncle Ray And she's trying to calm her nerves As I observe this is just one day And what tomorrow has in store We can never be sure, so all we can do is... pray   Because of your strength While I walked upon thee For God is my defense (pray for me!)  [Verse 2: Jay-Z] As I head to my homeroom I observe the ruins, dope needles on the ground I hear a car go, ""Vroom"" Drug dealer in the BM with the top down As the girls start to giggle I ask, ""Why you laugh?"", they say, ""You're too little One day you'll understand when you become a man About things you have to get you"" Fast forward, freeze frame on my pistol Fistful of dollars, ignorance is so blissful I didn't choose this life, this life chose me Around here it's the shit that you just do I just left school The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue They had their guns drawn, screaming, ""Just move!"" ""Or is there something else you suggest we can do?"" He made his way to the trunk, opened it like, ""Huh?"" A treasure chest was removed Cops said he'll be back next month What we called corrupt, he calls paying dues Now when the rules is blurred As they is and were, what am I to do? But pray? Pray the Lord forgive me Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through, pray   Deliver me in thy righteousness And cause me to escape And climb thine air unto me Save me thine Lord (pray for me!)  [Verse 3: Jay-Z] Geah.. anywhere there's oppression And the drug profession Flourishes like beverages, refreshing (ahhh!) Sweet taste of sin Everything I seen made me everything I am Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg What came first? Moving chickens or the egg? This is why I be so fresh I'm trying to beat life 'cause I can't cheat death Treat shame with shamelessness Aim stainlesses at anuses, you know the game this is? Move coke like Pepsi Don't matter what the brand name is I stand behind mine Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine I'm not an angel, I'm sure, but every night before I lay I drop my knees to the floor and I pray   The name shall endure forever The name shall be continued as long as the sun (pray for me!) Men shall be blessed in Him All nations shall call Him blessed In your name I pray... (pray for me!) Lord bless us"

Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it? I help them see they way through it—not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt   Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute ‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?

But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment? Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)

Carter Collection,2011-10-12," First thing that comes to my mind when you say ""Jay-Z"" is poetry. I mean, his whole—it's his attitude, aside from his words. What's heartfelt about him is, like—it's—you know, it's like—moving words, you know? It's really—it's—it's not just like when you think of rappers, and you think of—you know, um, those are poets. But his—his main... The good thing about Jay is that his integrity is what sells. What crosses over is his honesty. So he's never been untrue to himself—his self, and, uh... I think, see—as much as he seems to be a mainstream artist and has sold mainstream numbers, he's always spoken to the heart of his—his, uh—his environment. Other words: as he's traveled, he's seen new things, but through the eyes of someone who—who, um—obviously didn't have all the access. You know, he came from a place of struggle. And he sees the world as a person who's come from struggle. And so that honesty and that integrity that's always inherent in his music is what gives him his range. People buy him from places... People who are from places that are far removed from where, uh, Jay-Z came from, and the worlds that he's described, and even the kind of viewpoint that he has as a result of his history. Those people love him for his integrity and his honesty. Jay-Z reminds us that the truth sells. Uh, a lot of rappers—uh, uh—become more commercial. I mean, as the world—you know—more commercial aspirations for record companies that really, you know, pushed—put pressure on artists, kind of giving them these—these guidelines, and uh—these high numbers that have to sell to kind of live in this rap world. They kinda—some are inspired by that, and some write songs that sound like they're compromised by that. Jay-Z has contributed, um, uh, another honest blow to the integrity of hip-hop   Talk about Jay-Z, the rapper, for a second. We always hear how he's one of the best lyricists—   Cats sucking his dick by saying that. Bruh, it's ridiculous..."

Hectic Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message It said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare' Ay there's money to be made and, niggas got the picture Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff had warrants The other half in the casket lay dormant I felt like life was cheating me For the first time in my life I was getting money But it was like my conscience was eating me Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back? Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad? Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack? Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack And not collide like two trains that's on the same track But, get my life together like the oils I bring back In the bottom of the pot where the, water gets hot Got my transporter take it across the border then stop To set up shop with a quarter of rock Here's the plan: for three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops And this unstable way of living just, had to stop Half of my niggas got time, we done real things By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind I figured, ""shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?"" The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate So high in one city they send National Guards to get me Ya dig? The streets"

All they see is paper, not potential And they don't have a nigga's back when he's in limbo And I ain't asking you to do a life bid with me I don't want you to die for me, baby, live with me I'm just saying, when the going gets rough Don't forget all the shine at the time I was showing up Show me the same love you showed me when blowing up You told me it was Roc for life, then throw it up   When the money goes, will the honey stay? When the grey skies replace the sunny days Hey, hey, hey"

I can see it clear as day, you smacking my mom I 'member that day you showed me that gat, that 9 Put it in my palm when I was young and said that would be mine You turned me out, the reason why I hit the block Reason why I tried to hit them cops Reason why I started hitting shots Reason why I started getting licked and drinking syrup and skipping court Gingerbread Man never think of getting caught Look at your hands, man—damn you fought Nigga you left my mom Left us with no good-byes, you left us out to dry You left us with no letters, notes, no replies (nothing!) No digits, numbers was unlisted You left us with some of my loneliest nights Nigga, some of my hungriest nights Shit, one of the reasons for years (shit embarrassing) Damn, we used to think money was white Yeah you gave us life, like, fruit from a plant We ain't eat right from them foods from them stamps And to think, you was my pop, man, I gotta stop... shit  [Chorus: L.

Do you even remember the tender boy You turned into a cold young man with one goal and one plan? Get mommy out of some jam, she was always in one Always short with the income, always late with the rent You said that you was coming through, I would stay in the hallway Always playing the bench (waiting) and that day came and went FUCK YOU very much, you showed me the worst kind of pain But I'm stronger and trust me, I will never hurt again Will never ask mommy ""Why daddy don't love me? Why is we so poor? Why is life so ugly? Mommy, why is your eyes puffy? Please don't cry everything'll be alright I know it's dark now, but we gon' see the light It's us against the world, we don't need him, right?"" (Right!) Mommy driving 6's now (yeah), I got riches now (yeah) I bought a nice home for both of my sisters now We doing real good, we don't miss you now See how life twists around, fucker?  [Chorus: L. Dionne (Beanie Sigel)] Daddy, where have you been? (And when you come home, you got us here all alone) Mommy, where daddy went?

How real is, this? (Brooklyn) Uh-huh huh  (Brooklyn) Respect this here, check!   I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust I don't know what the fuck they thought Those niggas is foul just like us I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas? Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all? I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all   Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) (Brooklyn... so where you from?)

Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves Where we call the cops the A-Team 'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize? If the shit is lies, God strike me and I got a question Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice   Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) (Brooklyn... so where you from?)   Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off leak And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat Whether you're four-feet or Manute size, it always starts out with Three dice and shoot the five Niggas thought they deuce was live, now I hit 'em with trips And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood, where I'm from   Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice (Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own) (So where you from?)"

I turned around and I sold you crack I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse I hated me and everybody that created crack Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat Still haven't apologized, so please play this back While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain All I did was think about how the funds once came Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came That's a savage, you're the reason Why me and these beats make a marriage Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be You must love me   You must love me... Say that you love me All I know say that you must love me Ohh yeah  [Verse 2: Jay-Z] We used to fight every night but I never would suffer Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher As we grew fussing and fighting continued As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school Got intense, real intense as we got older Never believed it would lead to me poppin' one in your shoulder Where my rings? Knew you had it 'cause you took too long As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride Made our way down the steps Maybe you thought it was just a threat Or maybe ya life was just that crazy And you was beggin' for death Try to justify this in my young mind But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined Drove me berzerk, saw the devil in your eyes High off more than weed Confused, I just closed my young eyes and squeezed What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time To see ya stumbling to the ground Damn! what the fuck I done now? Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga Left the scene, how could I go out that way? Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day You must love me   You must love me... What after all the wrong I've done I know you must  [Verse 3: Jay-Z] Everything in my power and within my frame To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game But you was one of the few people that I can trust And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no When it was one of those days when nobody was around And I needed emergency trip out of town Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know As you stared in my face asking me could you go I agreed said send her everything'll go smooth Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through Strapped her body with them thangs as you boarded the plane Couldn't explain these strange feeling that I caught in the vein I'm thinking why would I send you when I knew it ain't right I'm thinking what would make you sacrifice ya life You must've love me   (""You must love me"" repeats in background) After everything that I've done wrong I know inside you must love me I know that you love me You showed me I know it I know Say that you love me Say that you love me I know you must love me Oh yes you do Inside I know it You've always shown it You love me yea yeah Oh yeah I know that you love me"
