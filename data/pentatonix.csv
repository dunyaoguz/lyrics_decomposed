Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth   No more lives torn apart That wars would never start And time would heal all hearts And everyone would have a friend And right would always win And love would never end This is my grown-up Christmas list   This is my only life I wish This is my grown-up Christmas list"

Let it go, let it go I walk with the wind and sky Let it go, let it go You'll never see me cry Here I stand And here I'll stay Let the storm rage on  My power flurries through the air into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast I'm never going back, the past is in the past  Let it go, let it go When I'll rise like the break of dawn Let it go, let it go That perfect girl is gone Here I stand In the light of day  Let the storm rage on  The cold never bothered me anyway"

We'll say: No man But you can do the job when you're in town  Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid, the plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland  In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he's a circus clown We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman Until the other kid is knockin' him down  When it snows, ain't it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland  Here's a little song I wrote You might want to sing it note for note Don't worry, be happy Don't worry be happy now  Don't worry Don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now Don't worry, 'cause we're walking in a winter wonderland"
