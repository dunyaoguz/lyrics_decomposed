Well that made her smile like she hadn't smiled in years And in just a second that smile turned to tears   He used to love me like crazy You couldn't pull us apart God, I felt so unbelievable in his arms But now she's catching her self Looking down at her ring every now and then She don't want to leave She just needs him to be that way again   She left that little cafe, she headed straight to her car She picked up her phone, he didn't say hi, he just said Hey when you getting home?   She said, you used to love me like crazy You couldn't pull us apart God, I felt so unbelievable in your arms But now I'm catching myself Looking down at my ring every now and then I don't want to leave you I just need you to be that way again   I don't want to leave you I just need you to be That way again"

These are the voices, won't leave me alone Questions I can't put down   What keeps you up at night? What makes your heartbeat wild? What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed? What keeps you up at night? Alright   See I believe in God, with all my heart Sometimes I doubt and wonder And I know that'd break my mamma's heart And that weighs on me like thunder Are these the best days of my life? And when tomorrow comes Will the skies open up, and blow my mind?   What keeps you up at night? What makes your heartbeat wild? What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed? What keeps you up at night?   What makes you take a stand? Want to get up and dance? What makes you laugh, you cry? Raise your hands to the sky? What keeps you up at night?   For all the times I've run, the things I've done Have I really been forgiven Do I really know the real meaning Of this beautiful life I'm living? Well hell yeah I do, it's my kids And what they learn from me Will they take the good, or take the bad?   What keeps you up at night? What makes your heartbeat wild? What weighs on your mind, leaves you paralyzed? What keeps you up at night?   What makes you take a stand? Want to get up and dance? What makes you laugh, you cry? Raise your hands to the sky? What keeps you up? What keeps you up? What keeps you up at night?"
