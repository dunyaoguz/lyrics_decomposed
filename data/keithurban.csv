I never work on a Sunday I've got a life of my own And this here is the one day I spend with my family at home   I finally got back home and it took forever Then at work the next day Somebody said ""Hey the boss said he wants to see you in his office right away"" He told me just how far behind the work was getting And on the weekend could I stay I started laughin' and said 'You must be kiddin' I just got one thing to say... You know what I said...
