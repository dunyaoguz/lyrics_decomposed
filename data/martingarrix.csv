Is your heart racing? Is that fire in your veins? Are your bones burning? Is your skin yearning? Cause you're driving me insane   I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light You got me way up, a thousand miles Can we stay right here in this atmosphere Like we're flying in outer space?   Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground Don't look down See that sky, we're gonna reach it now Do you feel the lightning inside of you? Will you follow through if I fall for you? Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground   Are your hands shaking? Are your fists breaking? Are you climbing over walls? Are the times changing? Is the noise fading? Cause I wanna get it out   I kinda feel like I, feel like I saw the light You got me way up, a thousand miles Can we stay right here in this atmosphere Or are you afraid to fall?   Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground Don't look down See that sky, we're gonna reach it now Do you feel the lightning inside of you? Will you follow through if I fall for you? Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground   Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground Don't look down See that sky, we're gonna reach it now Do you feel the lightning inside of you? Will you follow through if I fall for you? Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground   Do you feel the lightning inside of you? Will you follow through if I fall for you? Don't look down Up this high, we'll never hit the ground"
