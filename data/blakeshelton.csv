When the wine wears off And the buzz is gone When the room stops spinning round and round Will you still be holding on? Have we lost our minds Or is your kiss that strong? Tell me, will you still be mine Baby, when the wine wears off?   When I wake up in the morning Will you be in my arms? When the sun starts shining through those blinds Will you mean what you said in the dark Or will I have a headache and a broken heart?   When the wine wears off And the buzz is gone When the room stops spinning round and round Will you still be holding on? Have we lost our minds Or is your kiss that strong? Tell me, will you still be mine Baby, when the wine wears off?   I don't want you to stop kissing me now Keep on loving me, laying me down I'll close my eyes and hide from these doubts Do my best to not worry about   When the wine wears off And the buzz is gone When the room stops spinning round and round Will you still be holding on? Have we lost our minds Or is your kiss that strong? Tell me, will you still be mine Baby, when the wine wears off?   Will you still be mine Baby, when the wine wears off?"

My oh my, you're so good-looking Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends But I've not tasted all your cooking Who are you when I'm not looking?   I want to know I want to know I want to know   Do you break things when you get mad? Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad? Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails? Call up mamma when all else fails?  Who are you when I'm not around? When the door is locked and the shades are down? Do you listen to your music quietly? And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?   I want to know I want to know I want to know   My oh my, you're so good-looking But who are you when I'm not looking?"

We'll say: No man But you can do the job When you're in town   Later on, we'll conspire As we dream by the fire To face unafraid The plans that we've made Walking in a winter wonderland   In the meadow we can build a snowman And pretend that he's a circus clown We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman Until the other kids knock him down   When it snows, aren’t it thrilling Though your nose gets a chilling We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way Walking in a winter wonderland   Walking in a winter wonderland Walking in a winter wonderland"
