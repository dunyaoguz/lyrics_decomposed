I built me a castle With dragons and kings And I'd ride off with them As I stood by my window And looked out on those Brooklyn roads  Thought of going back But all I'd see are stranger's faces And all the scars that love erases But as my mind walks through those places I'm wonderin' What's come of them?

Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh, hey Jingle bells! Jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh   Now the ground is white Go it while you're young Take the girls tonight And sing this sleighing song Just get a bob-tailed bay Two-forty as his speed Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack You'll take the lead   Jingle bells!

Me and you  I never knew before that two was more Than one and one until that night Was nothing I could do But think of how I'm losing you, and It shook me, it shocked me, you locked me out there  Looking for a place I could hide Searching for a corner to turn Left me here alone for one night Showed me I had something to learn I tried not to need you, but I needed you anyway Wouldn't be easy to say, but the way that I see it I'm half without you, and I'm not gonna make myself whole Without the power of two... Me and you  Morning couldn't wait I knew that it was getting late, but I hung on I had no choice at all, was either walk away or crawl, and I'm pleading, I'm bleeding I think I'm falling deeper into that hole Deeper that I thought I could get Like a bug that's stuck in a bowl climbing out's impossible, yet He keeps trying harder, harder than he thought he could I finally understood I could hear, I could see, and the truth came through We had ten times the power of one We had the power of two... Me and you Was nothing we couldn't do Just me and you We had the power of two"

Was it something that I said? Lovers walk along a shore And leave their footprints in the sand Was the sound of distant drumming Just the fingers of your hand? Pictures hanging in a hallway Or the fragment of a song Half-remembered names and faces But to whom do they belong? When you knew that it was over Were you suddenly aware That the autumn leaves were turning To the color of her hair?  Like a circle in a spiral Like a wheel within a wheel Never ending or beginning On an ever-spinning reel As the images unwind Like the circles that you find In the windmills of your mind

You know when you needed me I was right there by your side But now you don't need me no more It's a fast goodbye, don't you cry  You'll forget You'll forget that you loved me And you'll stop thinkin' of me You'll forget What you feel right now, but how?  You'll forget You'll forget that you loved me And you'll stop thinkin' of me You'll forget what you feel right now But how?"
