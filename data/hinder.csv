Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?   And I'm still closing down these streets I'm high enough to make believe That I ain't ever gonna hit the ground The one that got away from me Every now and then she calls to see If I'm alive or plan to settle down Well, I called her drunk last night And I think I heard her say   What ya gonna do When the whiskey ain't working no more? Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?   I can't sleep and I can't hide 'Cause the voices in my head are getting louder Getting louder every night I'm living life with no regrets They're on their way but ain't here yet   What ya gonna do When the whiskey ain't working no more? Life don't feel like before What ya gonna do? What ya gonna do When the ride ain't climbing no more? Nobody's beatin' down your door What ya gonna do?
