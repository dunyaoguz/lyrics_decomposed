As long as it flows Winds go deeper Gouge out those false words Pile them up Wash away the footprints ahead Cajole us, make us forget and let us go In return for the presents We hand out"

If I dive off there It'll beyond me and everything goes forward I raise my arm, thinking I understood I follow this large line of people Conversation is the only way, I release and return Connected and go on The course to a conclution A beautiful time has passed Only the darkness and vivid red flash over the road The light is too small Can't see ahead We reach our hands to our destination  Who is to blame for this heart that killed Had a will to return, but he reproached me Solidly wait for a next chance Why he seems so gentle is because he is wrapped In a curtain and a shower of light And he hides the truth with the language He had barely studied. We don't wish to, but he talks The opposite. Holding the peace as an excuse Words he tells are vague. Acceptants don't bother to Replace them into their own words They just repeat what they're told Even truths are known Even everything is understood Reconciliation covers whole It changes the air. It changes the faces  Stare at only a moment ahead and hold on to tomorrow Not only the right things exist Crucial to think about it but the acceptants don't even think They pretend they are not listening They must have heard They must have seen Have a conviction but to be vanished deeply in grumble The time was surely beautiful It had been sunk into oblivion Standstill is an absolute necessity. I look around Despair and the speed overflow in my mind  (English translation)"

You draw a loop in A heart running short Untie a tangle thread And talk about tomorrow Step on the stretching shadow And talk about tomorrow  Who did you put out for? You rise for the future Bring time into your mouth Ears not necessary Your eyes won't Reflect your heart anymore. Look down And wish for the sequel to dream Sequel to dream that you can pass out  ""When the time comes...""say the voice A shaking voice just before the last scene Shoulder the great ideology just like Carving those words on the heart  Take it back, give it, use it And render pointless What's repeated are the philosophy I've already learned I wish for another hapiness It brings despair and arguments at the Same time You said that you Can't come back are gone A blast blows me out"

Why she holding that hard spoon? And where is my Head of State?

Fall asleep within the sound Leaving us behind  A face of darkness is so peaceful. We got a little envious of it I reflect my thoughts and prayed for my pain to stop I became naught for a will remains in the ashes My heart moves and gets high. My eyes freeze on My heart avoids the truth and the eyes And now the words echo. They were spelled by scraping my life Now the voice I kept screaming crossing my mind Cry only once and now I desperately ride on time Divided and found, I saw the end The answer I tell by ceasing Farewell is incomplete Believe and doubt The the beginning starts  (English translation)"

Even at the dawn of the next day Sent back to the same spot again on a fixed hand  Couldn't tell I'm supported. Even I knew it Dreams I catch are superficial and childish. Lost a way to go rot Tighter fetters wear me out. Rob, robbed and disappear The remainder of obedience still chokes my neck and chest  What we found in time Hidden, never been understood Want other things for next Steal, breathe both past and future  What is epoch? What is today. The ties of life so fragile so vain Smashing each others mind. What is ideal. What is value Near nothing. The character is formed Wait not for tomorrow. People follow Slight expectation. Caved in and sunk  In the line of people receiving values A wond on my finger pictures the shadow A crack of breeze indicates tomorrow In a song, I curse. I set my mind higher  I smile without seeing the precious words of mind Fix my gaze upon the despair ahead. Am I sad... Dying as I live. Will I be in time...  Replace my memories with things I have forgotten Accept every distorted thing I see I go forward fearlessly for perfection My heart is in the other place Deserted my weakest voice  Familiar lonesome face also found what it means to think Wish for the end in my heart again and again  In sadness, a heavy will I hold humbly. Turn it into words And show it a little. Reflect the hope and shimmer on Darkness where the light reaches I feel a mind that walks all the way with the darkness An old memory driven mad  (English translation)"

Derangement of dreams Lending and borrowing of lives. Mask's eyes  Lies of a bouquet. Melting ice Actual pain. Consciousness sleeps Change of the seasons. The pure world  The moon grieves in the daytime Winds sliced by autumn Fallen fragments Faces dyed in red Greatest pleasure is over Silhouettes of men disappeared See the pointless true motive I lent on top of the layered sweat I fly this day with the crooked wings"

In order to devise things which are not Required, I stop my motion Wipe out And quash out from my memories  I spat out All that was correct Ideals at the starting point There the steps start to drag  You believe the unilateral force is What everyone wait for You test us A halting trial leads to Misfortune and obligations In the future to tell the hardships Throat had slashed Fingers seperated Cling to the ground And wait impatiently forever  Devil is about to be born  Which is the road you made and left Behind? You shall deprive all from me Where is the heart you lost? You are not allowed to take it back You go get frightened on your blunders"
/songs/1282645,Nico & Vinz,The Unknown Glow,https://genius.com/Nico-and-vinz-the-unknown-glow-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/1282645,None,2018-09-07,"English:  Just like the poem tells the marked destiny Find the heartbeat hanging faraway Future lines up in front grows immaturely The goal is the liberation of a mind. Guilt chase It goes as it wishes, hiding the abnormity Will you smile? Will you notice? The painful lifeless shell after the exhaustion It's you who gets hurt And the questions have tossed in You have no words worth to answer  Circulating water stopped by the damage Your understanding is stuffed and goes wrong You talk your past in vain The forgotten current, is it still free?  The difference of reflection Exists in a line between The manipulated ones and the thinkers Returning is equal to a total denying You find happiness at the dark bottom Believe in the false power Flirt with the smell The voices won't reach It always become the scream of the defeated ones Beloved place we go hand in hand Has the same color Force ourselves to overcome Those problems that make no sense Many things for me to grasp But for you they make no sense Being chased around by My own sense of values And it shuts down my paths You just have to set it free Not to restrict Beliefs and individual ideals Ends by telling And tommorow also ends  Repeat the tiny happiness Pass by the everyday life Charmed by the temporary change Accompanied the established trust Lies are inevitable Need those words that went away And the tiny voice floats in times And echoes forever The road never disappears And the spreading smoke wraps The colorless times You just have to receive My meaningless words Are the questions to myself Everything is here It disappears in a moment  You just have to let the voice delivered This sound, and the proof of heart I go save the hanging thoughts. In hurry These feet go where they should go to Carry the wishes to the quiet place Where the pieces sleep  At a quick pace I'm going to the place Where many of them glow Ceasing stands for the beautiful Setback and segmentation Overcome the black plots With the white gentleness Many stares betrayed the time  I carry my exhausted body Bring the unknown glow into a life Start up the thoughts To the future. Ahead of us The stretch of a light we saw is The scar of hundreds of answers Paint. Paint the weakness of The ones who creep along"

Twisted past A light glared from victim's fingertips  Fulfilled sense of values are Given birth repeatedly Between strangling realities And victims who open their sparkled eyes Going forward without look back and bend Piece the reason on a hand and show it False light we create and throw out  Inside the accepting light my hand has ben cut off It drifts into history not even aware of graspingness The place I search as I drift I sit in. Never to make it to the place And find the chilly gentleness of the ground  Warm gentleness squashes And buries a mind suffers a setback A mind that gives off a light excludes The ones who can't walk straight The weak ones arms are fallen from light Both arms keep moving forever With their fingers bended over  (English translation)

Responsibilities passed around and Sank into oblivion Shifted a stare gently Dedicated to your shoes and The world to come"
