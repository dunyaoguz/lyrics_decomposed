Oh, if I knew what had been there waiting I'd have screamed out and jumped up  Now here I am With my feet on the sand And a body that won't move The tide's coming in And I'm bound for a swim In a pair of cement shoes  He takes what he can, what he wants Doesn't matter if it's ever been given I took the bait and a chance on a man Sold by the boy that he lived in  And I was wrong to believe that strength makes you strong And I had hope in a change I would see in us both And now I'm heavy He lifts me, but never once carried Door number two, I've already walked through  Ask me the question: Who coulda guessed I would be here at this crossroad? Plain to be seen that it's all up to me I'm no longer alone, though  And nothing's changed And I see it more every day Nothing moves It's a game to be played and to lose  And now I'm heavy, unsteady But maybe I'm getting ready And this might catch fire and char this ground  I might lift this up to only be the one Who's gonna get let down Will I be enough to get this on its way To find some higher ground? Before the waters rush, I've got to make a change Or else I know I'll drown  Baby, look around Door number two, I've already walked through I wanna see what's behind door number three"

Welcome it in Whatever the day brings More of the same things  Check the clock tick tick tock don't stop serve with a smile Hurry up fill the coffee cup and then in a while Take a breath when you need to be reminded that with Days like these We can only do the best we can Then do it all again  It's the heartbeat The center The lifeline You enter  Opening up Letting the day in Pour you a cup And say ""Hello, how you been?""

I don't like guessing games or when I feel things Before I know the feelings How am I supposed to operate if I'm just tossed around by fate? Like on an unexpected date  With a stranger who might Talk too fast Or ask me questions about myself before I've decided that He can ask me questions about myself He might sit too close or call the waiter by his first name Or eat Oreos But eat the cookie before the cream but what scares me the most... What scares me the most...  Is what if when he sees me What if he doesn't like it? What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it What happens then if When he knows me He's only disappointed What if I give myself away to only get it given back I couldn't live with that So I'm just fine inside my shell-shaped mind This way I get the best view So when he sees me, I want him to  I'm not defensive I'm simply being cautious I can't risk reckless dating Due to my miscalculating why A certain suitor stands in line I've seen in movies Most made for television You cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life I could end up a miserable wife  He could be criminal Some sort of psychopath who escaped from an Institution somewhere where they don't have girls He could have masterminded some way to find me He could be color blind How untrustworthy is that? He could be less than kind Or even worse he could be very nice have lovely eyes And make me laugh Come out of hiding What do I with that? Oh god  What if when he sees me I like him and he knows it What if he opens up a door and I can't close it What happens then If when he holds me My heart is set in motion I'm not prepared for that I'm scared of breaking open But still I can't help from hoping To find someone to talk to Who likes the way I am Someone who when he sees me, wants to again"
