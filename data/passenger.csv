I see nothing brave in getting drunk just to sour The sweetness of a broken heart  I've drunk so much coffee my eyes have started to twitch And eaten so much tapas that it's made me feel sick She's got a new Spanish boyfriend Probably with a massive dictionary in English So they understand each other better  You see I spent all my money to feel anything but regret Spent two days in Catalonia that I would sooner forget And I've cried at the airport into a stale jamón baguette It's not my idea of a good time  You know everybody's told me at least I've done all I can do It makes me feel no better 'cause I don't believe it's true I could take a sniper rifle onto her Spanish boyfriend through"

What's left to see when our eyes won't open? What's left to do when we've lost all hope and What's left to break when our hearts are broken? But sometimes...   Do you remember how this started out? So full of hope and now we're filled with doubt A dirty joke we used to laugh about But it's not funny any more   I fear I choke unless I spit it out Still smell of smoke, although the fire's gone out Can't live with you, but I die without   What's left to say when every word's been spoken? What's left to see when our eyes won't open? What's left to do when we've lost all hope and What's left to break when our hearts are broken? But sometimes...

He lit up a cigarette and began to talk  Said, ""The doctors told me that my body won't hold me My lungs are turning black Been a Lucky Strike's fool since I was at school and there ain't no turning back They can't tell me how long I've got Maybe months but maybe not So I'm taking this bike and riding to New York  Cause I wanna see my grand-daughter one last time Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny heartbeat next to mine Wanna see my son and the man he's become Tell him I'm sorry for the things I've done And I'd do it if I had to walk I'm taking this bike and riding to New York  Through the forests of Wisconsin that I knew as a boy Past the sky line of Chicago Round the lakes of Illinois I lay my head in a motel bed where my back is sore and my eyes turn red Listen to the trucks roll past my door Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turnpike tolls And I won't stop 'till I get to New York  Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time Wanna see his eyes sparkling and stare back into mine Now my time is shorter I wanna see my daughter Tell her I'm sorry for the things I taught her And I'd do it if I had to walk Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York  And I'd go up to the churchyard one last time Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me the best years of my life And I'd do it if I had to walk I'd do it if I had to walk I'm taking this bike and riding to New York."""

But my words like silent raindrops they fell, And echoed, In the wells of silence  And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking oh People hearing without listening oh People writing them songs, that voices will never share  Oh, and the people bowed and prayed, to the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets Are written on the subway walls, And tenement halls."" But can’t you see that we’re lost And thank you so much, for silence knows"

Will we walk all night through solitary streets?)   And you hardly can imagine What you never had before And the reason that you're given Still leaves you wanting more  And you hardly can imagine What you never had before And the reason that you're given Still leaves you wanting more   I rise to meet you As your trust dissolves to shame Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way Retrace the footprints Off the path from which I came I'm the beast in you, the beast in me The bitterness, the jealousy The part of you that never sleeps"
