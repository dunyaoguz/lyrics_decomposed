It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out Just because your bank account gets all figured out Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit And they ain't major shit Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life I always say long days is better than long nights At least in the day you've got shade In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights 'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe But I didn't know it was off of infested streets Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat I guess that's the hunger that got me out At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?

Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you How old or young minded someone is Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs But each have our own finish line Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong Better to be in the hall of fame than shame Whether it exists for what you do or not We create this world so we make what exists It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized And remembered for all the right reasons Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps So when it's so late that it's early And you need a drink even though the bar's closed Remember why you do what you do For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about With who thinks about you: Your family, your team The joy of looking back and saying that you did it Winning the game: hall of fame"

Yup you were so embarrassed See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”   And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything No, no, no not anything and you Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you   My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full What about the emails you hacked in? I know we hate to live in the past-tense It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D And ain’t came back since Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city That’s about the time that you left for the city You and all your girls moved to NY I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up? I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl Almost broke every promise to ya girl Brought problems to your world And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?” I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to And when Thanksgiving come around I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma So it’s back to the drama “No I don’t know that number” “Why the hell you text it?” Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in Young and living reckless   And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything No, no, no not anything and you Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you   I can't imagine myself without you I need a whole lot of help without you Me and my granny both agreed Damn you're such a G I’ll hold you down forever, B   And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world And I, just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything No, no, no not anything and you Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you"

When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful  And that we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don’t fuck with each other  Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I’m still praying   For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game How much it cost? Around twenty88 Going off like Kobe when he wore the Crazy Eights All y’all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape Shot my first video in the Harajuku store With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can’t take Yeah with Hype Williams directing each take And GOD directing each step that we take  I’m a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy  10 years in and a nigga still under 30 I’m feeling like an old man that failed at life Got reincarnated to do it all again right (that's how I feel) So I’m treating every second like it's an investment  Time is money, every second I’m collecting   Don’t ask me no stupid questions  ""Are you still signed to YE?"" questions, no Roc nation questions  Or who I’m dating questions, look, no more interviews  Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view And not the shit that's getting the hits and views Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved  My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons  I realize it ain’t what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is I am the one of one, after me there's no successor   DON"

Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true? Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes? Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues? Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow? Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance When it's all finished Guess that depends on how you live Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did   But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?

I really do wonder When all I did was safe sex, latex The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck But I ain't flunk once Back before I got drunk once I was smoking on haze, all in a daze My homies would call and say, ""nigga, come roll""   The D grown us to get it man. You know what I’m mean? Just hustle, hustle, hustle. They, you know we, you know, there really wasn’t that much opportunity for us, man. So, we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and, and learn the game   Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile, they call that the better mile Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style Free Juan, let him out And everything I want off in the world is a must-have I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap"" Cause there's niggas in the streets Getting money under my nose that I must stash I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit Cops should've protect-and-served and shit But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit Ask ""why the attitude?"" cause bitch, you deserve that shit Bang bang bang, how do you maintain A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s? When only language they know English and gang signs Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll   Well shit, I’m just, you know, I’m proud of lil' bro man.

I mean like I say the Linwood man, shit that’s what we know the city man, that’s for the city man all fucking day   Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?"
