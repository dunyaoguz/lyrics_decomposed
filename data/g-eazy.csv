Guess that she was upset That was about the time she stormed off, steaming mad She was bad but I just let Her go, why you sweat girls like a fur coat In the summertime? You're a nerd bro Never leave work never furlough Think you're fucking with me? K, sure bro Ready all times say the word go Sippin' drinking merlot, started drinking early Still the same Gerald half killer, half nerdy So far, my 20's they've been one hell of a journey Bob Dylan told me don't trust no one over 30 Damn, draped in Saint Laurent and Supreme Amount of money that I spend on what I want is obscene All surreal how we live this good off of a dream And I swear I do it all for the team Drunk off of the Heem Truly feel I'm the coldest alive All I do is work, focus, and strive Split a swisher, roll a fatty I'mma smoke this and drive I'm a threat, now some of you can really only hope to survive Grab a glimpse I'm as rare as it gets Forget whoever else you might've thought was apparently next Out here and I'm blessed I come to town and every girl in the city's at my show and all the parents get stressed I'm maneuvering with flair and finesse Working out so I could carry the west I'll prepare for the test and I'm ready after 5 sets Lift the whole bay with my biceps Caution if you try to follow my steps You will trip and fall get exhausted and collapse Most of these haters carry germs so I'm cautious giving daps I just can't fuck with everyone my circle stays the same size Enjoy the lifestyle that fame buys After party is at Drai's in Vegas where they have the view Get some girls, grab a few but only bring the baddest through Rappers imitate the style, I'm not even mad at you I'm not even throwing shade, I just overshadow you Yeah I'm in my own lane, run my own pace Chasing nobody marathon my own race I do it for the bay area that's home base They try to run next to us but there ain't no space I feel like life just switched to hyperspeed though as of recent The difference between yourself and me is you're just decent A garden full of flowers grew its way up through the cement If I ever said I'm never scared just know I really mean it I dreamed about the top I had a vision and I seen it If you know the work comes first than you and I are in agreement And it's a long haul but I work harder than them all So come back in 5 years and we can talk about achievement   : Hey let me ask you something. Do you worry about achievement? Does it worry you or do you just do your own thing and say ""here it is you either accept it or not""? : Well, do I worry about achievement?  No I worry about a lot of things but I don't worry about achievement : No, well I'll scratch achievement off"

Are we transmitting? Are we transmitting? Just Roll Things are out of control down below People are dying in the streets by the thousands And the freeways Right now the freeways are hopelessly clogged There is no way out of the city I think we're safe for the moment but I'm not gonna stay long...

But shit!!  It’s a bitch, but school is the only guarantee. You get a degree you’re guaranteed to have a better chance at a better paying job than you would with a high school diploma. Hip-Hop has NO guarantee. & it doesn’t help that this recession got times harder then a guy watchin Halle Berry strip. U get the idea…  I just feel like now is the time… this music shit has to pop off.

Now your just pressin' to get some attention When I ignore you, then you try to threaten That you'll tell my girl 'cause you know it's a weapon You feed on the drama to fuel your obsession Fuck, I need a whisky, but leave it to you You'd prolly put poison inside it to kill me And get off not guilty, your antics are filthy 'Know what you want, it's just not what it will be!   When you're in my house I start to cry Take me baby, take me  to the other side Make me shake like you do every time Only you can keep me satisfied   Stay with me forever, don't leave I'll cry and beg and crawl on my hands and knees You can lock me in the dark Throw away the key For now I'll share, but soon you'll belong to me Belong to me, soon you'll belong to me Belong to me, soon you'll belong to me I'll lock you in the dark and throw away the key For now I'll share, but soon you'll belong to me   And why are you acting so possessive? Callin' all day, that's way too aggressive I can't belong to you Bitch you got me fucked up! I can't take you to the other side"

You know so much of hip-hop is a story of from nothing to something.  I've never owned a car in my life, I don't know when I would drive it. I've never owned a house, I don't know what I would do with it. I'd never be in it. People see celebrity as mansion, car, white teeth, and fancy clothes. You know but what they don't see is severe anxiety and fear of falling, cause there's no safety net under me.  There was no plan B there was no trust fund or anything like that. It was like ""this has to work."" Like have endless nights back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back to back killing yourself in the studio. Like the misery the pain. Does this mean anything? Is this trash? Like no one cares. You do not have an audience, no one cares about what you're making, it's all in your head. And I was just like determined, like it had to happen.  That's the thing about music is it's not like a 9 to 5 when you're done you go home. You have to run with it, you have to work your ass off and kill yourself to get any kind of results. I kill myself in the studio because I want to be great. You know, and I want to make something that matters to people. You have to project out into the universe what you want out of the world. You know, what do you want to be the best at? It didn't happen overnight, you know, so it's tough to look back and say like, ""well when did it happen?"" you know. ""When did your whole life change?"" I don't know, gradually over the last 5 years. So it's like, if I do want to have a house one day, if I do ever want to enjoy driving a car one day, it's not just gonna just fall in my lap, or maybe I don't know."
/songs/2304932,G-Eazy,The Pyramid Theory,https://genius.com/G-eazy-the-pyramid-theory-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/2304932,None,2019-01-26,"The cold truth about success in Hip-Hop  I took a recent trip out to New Mexico to help director Tyler Yee shoot a music video for an artist, and on this trip it hit me. Every rapper raps about money, but in reality 99.9 % of rappers never make a real dime off this music. So as I was thinking, I wrote this down in my iPhone and figured I would put it out as a blog…enjoy  The Cold Truth About Success In Hip-Hop, The Pyramid Theory  Group A: The very top of the pyramid (.01 % of the entire pyramid)  This section represents the extremely few rappers that make enough money annually to be set for life. (Dre, Eminem, Jay-Z, Ludacris, 50 Cent, etc.)  Group B: The top of the pyramid (.09% of the entire pyramid)  This section represents the few rappers that make enough money in their careers to live a portion of their lives well off. These cats usually will have one good year where they might go gold, or have a really big single, but they never make enough money to be set for life. (Jim Jones, Flo Rida, Juelz, Lloyd Banks, Styles P, Obie Trice, just to name a few). Still, this is an incredibly prestigous group, and only represents .09% of the rap pyramid  Group C: The near top of the pyramid (.4 % of the entire pyramid)  This section represents all the rappers that are regional stars, and can tour and do shows in their region, but never really break out and become stars nationally. These rappers never end up making enough money to live lavishly, and will probably have to find regular jobs after their careers fade. (Mistah F.A.B., Raw Dizzy AKA Raw D.I., The Frontline, most of Thizz Ent.). Chances are there are a few in your city, and if you don’t recognize the names I mentioned, then it proves my point exactly. These cats in this group are hardly recognized outside of their regions  Group D:  The rest of the pyramid (99.5 % of the entire pyramid)  This section represents everybody with 16 bars and a dream. Everybody with a rap group, a computer, a mic and ProTools. Chances likely you’ve done a few shows, but nothing big. You probably have a mixtape or 2 out, but you don’t have any distribution and you’re not on iTunes. This group makes nearly no profit off of rap. That means they’re broke  What this all means, is that .5 % of all rappers take in 99.9 % of the industry’s profits  So while the subject matter for nearly every rappers song is “I get money”, only .5 % of them are even making any money off of rap. And only .01% of them are REALLY  living like superstars  So this is my message to all you indy rappers, quit getting raped, step your game up! We’re letting a few cats take all of the loot. We need to work harder in this game. There’s a million rappers, but we’re letting like 10 cats eat the whole pie  If you don’t understand this idea, or if reading this blog doesn’t motivate you then you’re too dumb and don’t belong in the rap game. This shits a warzone, its time to step your game up. Get right or get left. There’s money to be made in this business, you just have to approach it in the right way… So ask yourself, which group do you want to be in? A, B, C or D??  To The Top  – G-Eazy"
/songs/2305211,G-Eazy,The Pyramid Theory Part 2:,https://genius.com/G-eazy-the-pyramid-theory-part-2-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/2305211,None,2019-01-26,"Climbing to the top  Yo so i got a lot of feedback from a blog I posted a couple weeks ago, where I pointed out the cold truth in terms of where exactly money is being made in hip-hop… and how everybody n their grandmama seems to rap, but in reality only half a percent of them are actually seeing profits from music… If you haven’t read it already go read it now… real talk… like now…  Cool 4sho…  U finished reading yet?  Aiight… So if you just read that, and u still think you’re trying to make it… then you’re extremely optimistic or just doin it for the luv. Either way, first you should realize that the odds are extremely against you, and that if you even want to make it into the third section as a regional star you’re going to have to have a few things going for u…  Number 1 – Absolute, 100% dedication of your time and energy  – You can’t half ass this shit for a second, so if you’re not about spending all your free time writing songs, workin in the lab, promoting, etc then it’s not gonna work. If you’d rather spend your time at the mall, at the movies, or playing madden then go find another line of work  Number 2 – Be humble and respectful  – This is very important: rappers, stay off your own dick! It’s important to have confidence but in order for anybody in this industry to wanna take a chance & fuck with you (managers, booking agents, graphic designers, etc) you’re gonna have to be cool as fuck. Nobody wants to work for free with a pre-modonna who thinks that everybody should automatically cater to them because their that dope.  Fuck that. Nobody owes you shit in this world, and you’re gonna need help, so be cool and act right and you’ll get it  Number 3 – A full time producer and a studio on deck – Basically you need a situation where you can make as much music as possible at the lowest input price (without having to pay a grip for beats and lab time) because chances are you’re going to have to make a LOT of music before you get a REAL hit. No matter how talented you are. Unless you have your own lab and make your own beats, this is also gonna take being cool and respectful, cuz some producer and some engineer is gonna have to give you free beats and lab time  The most important thing is be humble and respectful… Real talk… I’ve produced/worked with at least 50 rappers in my career, and all of yall think you’re the best at what u do. True a lot of yall are talented, but what’s talent if everybody can string together punchlines and drop a hot 16? It takes more then that  Also when it comes to paying dues, don’t ever get impatient. If you’ve got a situation where you’re comin up underneath somebody bigger than you, and you’re getting frustrated cuz you want to be the star, shut that shit up. Take whats being given and make the most of it. Either that or go out on your own and make it happen for yourself  If you are gonna do it all yourself tho, do as much as you can on your own that way when checks start coming in you won't have to split them with a gang of folks. Try & make your own beats, your own graphics, heavy myspace promo, etc. It’s gonna take mad time on a computer…  Which brings me to my next point, to be successful in 09, U kinda have to be a computer nerd to an extent… The game is all digital now, all that sellin mixtapes and physical CDs is all but over with. The more you can promote your music online the better. if you don’t have an online presence its a wrap. Selling mixtapes at the mall is getting you no where. Gaining an online fan base and selling your music on iTunes is the truth  Yo, so thats the game. Be smart & get on ya job if u wanna shine in 09  1"

Switchin' lanes when that Porsche shifts Homies movin' weight just like a forklift When my album drops, Jedis can feel the force shift Meanwhile, you lyin-ass rappers droppin' horse-shit Only pay attention if you pay me Chilling with a Sarah and a Vicky and a Jamie Just a young man living life, could you blame me?

I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...  Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...  For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....    [Verse 1: G-Eazy]  See...when I was younger, Mama told me, that the world wouldn't be good for me....  So I had to worry bout myself... just my lonely...  But only if I had known...  Maybe I wouldn't have roamed, looking round for an answer, while no daddy's 'round at home...  Or maybe it's because of all the drugs he was on, that he couldn't show no love to his own?  Two children and a family...  Got me askin, 'Why you always mad at me'?...  Yellin, screamin, pickin up shit, and throw it at me, but...  I grew up and got stronger...  Couldn't take it no longer... then became a man, and I ain't need a father, I mean....  Why even bother if nobody got no love for you?  Then why Imma worry about them?....  They wouldn't die for you!  They wouldn't try for you!  Take a bullet wound or two?  If you pass away tomorrow, they wouldn't even cry for you! but never, ever, would I let that make me less of a man! because my plan is to be better than him, when I'm a dad!      What is love?  I don't know what that means...  I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...  Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ....  For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....      What is love?  I don't know what that means...  I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...  Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...  For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....      Growing up, I used to dream for something close to a change....  And with every second and every other blink, it seemed fake....  In due time... I realize, that love was nothing but a word....  If god made it for a reason.... ""why'd he make it so it hurts?""...  And if with every second that passed, They say your family is there...  Supposed to respect them to an extent....but ain't ever supposed to be scared...  Because blood's supposed to be there;  Ready to take wounds...  And when it comes to guns, what you doin, when your mother's the one shootin?...  I wouldn't make it, but look now.....  I made it to a man!  And I don't call, cause I don't need you...that's something you gotta understand!  You 'love me' is bullshit...whats love got to do with it?  If your mama's the one that told you, that love don't even matter!  All the bruises and all the markings, it's just something without excuses  But the scarrings you brought up, had me worried to even do shit...  Cause if I would've made a move..... I could have made the wrong one!  But maybe me holding on kept me alive in the long run, let's go!      What is love?  I don't know what that means...  I came in this world by myself, thats all I need...  Everything you put me through.. all that shit you did ...  For my whole life, that's hard to forgive .....      What is love?
