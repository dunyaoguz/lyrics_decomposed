Just when the great ones inspire you To throw caution to the wind That's when the mirror mirror on the wall says ""Babe, you better throw your towel in.""   All that I don't know Paralyzes me But somehow I keep going on Just settling for this mediocrity And I wonder if god is trying to make a fool out of me   There are legends who die And I've never even heard their songs And there are heroes of a generation Whose poetry is not on my shelf And my soliloquies would make Shakespeare Turn over in his grave And voyagers would forbid me To join in their crusade   I wish I could fight against Ali and win I wish I could write with Joni Mitchell's pen Sail the Atlantic on a paddle boat I wish I could smile like Bobby de Niro I wish that the lotto was the number of my telephone I wish I could sing a duet with Bono 'Cause I don't want to sound like Anyone else, you know I just wanna take you under my spell Excuse me for saying What I know down deep is my sin But maybe I'll fool everybody into thinking I know just what I am doing  "

Don't have time for things unsaid For baking bread for love  All I need is room to fight Hand in fisted glove Point me to the sky It's my turn to fly  Don't you wanna be, the life of the party? Don't you wanna be, the top of the heap? This is where the jamboree never ends Why not be counting friends instead of counting sheep?  If you wanna join, the heavenly choir Hurry up and get yourself in line But don't you pass the life of the party Until you pass the wine  Let the drinks pour Let the crowds roar Let the Heavens wildly cheer  'Til the sunrise Brings the goodbyes I'll be here Never fear  Who's it gonna be, the life of the party? Who's it gonna be, the king of the hill? Don't you wanna be there, running the show Until it's time to go or 'til it's time to kill?  Don't you ever wanna be, somebody to envy Don't you wanna be, footloose and free? Well, you could be the life of the party If you were more like me"

Over and over figure it out Maybe today we'll find the message in the clouds Maybe tomorrow we'll crush a Nickel on a railroad track Time is running out I think I think too much Do you think about the guy That you first kissed? Yeah his tongue went in circles Practically missed your lips Do you think he's now the world's greatest lover? Or sitting at home Watching CNN on TNT or TV? Do you think about your past life? Were you a countess, or A vagabond or James Bond or Yeah, but bisexual Do you think I should care what you think?  (Chorus) Do you think about all the books You haven't read? Are you a street smart cat Or are you just an intellect? Do you think about this now: The girl who made you miserable In junior high; made you cry? Do you thinks she's smoking Like five packs of cigarettes a day And going to therapy... Wait I wasn't finished  (Chorus) Do you think it's normal For white people to wear dreadlocks? Are you a barefoot earthling Or a hermit in socks Guys in tuxedos are Kind of deceiving But you know, you see them in the park, jogging along It's a little more revealing Do you think about your funeral? If you died how many people Are gonna show up? Do you think we're capable of change Or we're just gonna, oh screw up our children? Do you think about fires- Who do you rescue first Your kids or your sleeping husband?"
