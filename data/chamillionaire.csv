I know a lot of people talk Like they don't write down their lyrics and they do it all in their head But me, hey I take pride in writing down lyrics man I used to scratch out everything on the paper And change the whole rap, up until I felt it was perfect I used to perfect my craft so much and just make each rap Be the best one that I could possibly make it And I try so hard to, you know To get back to that feeling I used to have, but I just can't you know I look at a piece of paper now and it just doesn't give me that same feeling it used to No matter how hard I try, people say that the industry will burn you like that And they say it's mainly because of the pressures in the record industry but I don't know man, I don't know what it is but I just know The same feeling I used to get from music, I just don't get anymore like I remember the feeling I used to get when I heard them live instruments on Snoop Dogg's Gin & Juice Or you know when 'Pac was going off on everyone in the industry or Or when Scarface and 2Pac did a song for the first time Or the first time I heard UGK's One Day I was like ""Maaaan"", them boys real Or even when I was bumping that east coast music And I heard Canibus say a verse on The Firm album, he was like ""At a thousand degrees Celsius I make y'all iggans melt F' my record label, I appear courtesy of myself!"" I was like ""Maaaaaaaan"" hahaha, man that boy killed dat And I even used to be bumping Wu-Tang Clan I remember Method Man was like, you know it um ""I came to bring the pain, hard core from the brain"" I was like ""Man them boy's throwed"" And I can't put the blame on nobody You know I can't just say I don't like music all music There's a lot of music I like, but I just don't like it the way I used to And that goes for all of it, including me Even when I'm in the studio, and I'm behind the mic It just ain't the same man, you know I like to talk man, that's the realest part of everything to me But I don't get to speak what's on my mind like I am now Like I do at the awards, you know? I mean I guess life goes on though Don't hurt 'em Hammer!"

What have you ever done? What have you ever did? It's rhetorical, don't answer that, cause you know what it is   When you're moving on up and everybody wanna roll They say they love me but I can never be sure So you know, you know I elevate on these hoes Elevate on these hoes They can talk down about me everywhere they go But they don't say it when they see me in the streets though So you know, you know I elevate on these hoes Elevate on these hoes   They'll tell you your fate I said you can't win What good's a hustle when your mentality caged in? I pull up on 'em, park it right up on the pavement Step out and look and be stuck in my own amazement And that feeling still ain't fulfilling Millions on top of millions, you gon' become the villain You see this one-room apartment where we was living? This why I'm claustrophobic and riding without the ceiling Guess who calling my number, sitting in her pajamas Feeling like it's a bummer that I ain't give her the lumber Tapping that like a drummer, turning her to a cummer Instead I'm somewhere in winter that's feeling like it's the summer Hold up, the garage as big as the court How you learn how to ball and not even get in the sport? Decorated the grill, made it look like an ESPY But you can't see the front when you in the rear trying to catch me   See I came up on that Scarface and I came up on that 'Kast That Pimp C and that Bun B the professors of my class When a major deal had came through, who came up on one last Same person that taught you how to come up on that cash They say that flattery's what you get from an imitator Gave birth to all my haters, I shouldn't have paid for your labor When you turn to the savior, they never ask for a favor Watch people that never gave you a favor act like they made ya But I gotta get mine, get, get in the rotation Gots to stay trill, never been a imitation Never stop mine, cause they come with complications Broke them boys off, caught 'em with intimidation Look in my eyes, try to tell me what you're facing Out the north side, it's a legend in the making Watch where I slide in the elevator though Elevate on these hoes Elevate on these hoes"

she cursed at my patna, yelling bout what she saw Asking him 'bout some lingerie that she found in her car I'm sitting back and I'm watchin, just trying not to get involved That's when I heard her say that she was ready to break the law A tricky situation I was currently facing The roommate or ya soul mate whose side are you taking I wasn't saying nothing, I was watching and waiting She's yelling and pacing and now she's adjacent To me, I was standing there quietly He started yelling when she tried to get behind me Then he put up his dukes like he thought he was Ali You swing at me they'll

the one who gave me permission I knew that it was evil but it made me feel dope The way she got me feeling I think we should elope She reached around my body then she pulled me real close She rubbed me on the face and said it's time to get ghost Your wish is my command, you rollin' I'm rollin' wit' ya You say it's time to split, don't worry I get the picture She grabbed me by the wrist, If I could I would kiss ya In all the chaos I didn't get to tell you I miss ya   I was thinking bout the cut, Like my mind was missing Sitting in the car, You know playing my position She drove up to the

Mixed with some liquor, it's a Bloody Mary Such a nasty flow it's unsanitary!

I see them watchin, they waitin For an opportunity to ride up on me Hopin they don't roll up on me, cause today I'm ridin dirty And if they stop me, I might be goin to jail tonight I see them watchin, and waitin For an opportunity to ride up on me Hopin they don't roll up on me, cause today I'm ridin dirty And if they stop me, I might be goin to jail tonight   (Ch-chea! Chamillitary mayne, uh, yeah) I got 20 grand in my pocket and I'm ridin' around with my pockets crammed You the one that got the contraband And you smokin that like you in Amsterdam Before I know it, I see them sirens I'm pullin' over - aye, we just ridin'! Don't talk back, won't be no violence Just shut up, and sit in your seat in silence Now the police is searchin who? They searchin me and then they searchin you They smell the breeze and you smell like trees Cause you hit the blunt and hit the purple, too Now the lie is irreversable Because you just told 'em we were ridin' clean They question you, but they ain't question me yet I'm thinkin the police ain't find a thing Standin on the side of the freeway Wishing they would just hurry up And I can see, you walkin up to me Like he about to put me up in them cuffs I turned around and I look at you And you look away like you feeling sick I'm goin to jail for what I didn't commit I must admit, that I hate a snitch     Ever since they heard the song ""Ridin' Dirty"" The whole world been listening, I'm glad you heard me Some cops that representin the badge assure me Every cop ain't bad or tryin to scurr me A year after ""White and Nerdy"" On the grind, still tryin, still flyin birdies That stuff still in ya cup, still drivin' swervy Ridin dirty like the vehicle inside the derby A little inspired by U.G.K And the rest inspired by the life I'm livin Seen that Impala, he was drunk And that's when I saw the red lights go get 'em And it's ironic that during the chase Seen ""Murder Chase"", and this kid was Christian Movin target ran across the street And unfortunately the car didn't miss him And now the family is soon to know That they gon have to do another funeral The angels ain't singin to ya tune no more Don't move too fast, baby move it slow Cause one day ya here, baby Next thing ya know, next thing ya know Everything that used to move don't move no more     (This is not a movie, it's real life, yeah, yeah...) It's real life, it ain't just a song, it's a message Nobody ever opens they eyes till somebody gets killed Rest in peace to Sean Bell Chamillitary Mayne"

Friendship and business don't mix With anyone else it's just business, with friends I'm personally pissed Is this a curse or a gift? Guess I was blessed with my wish Don't tell me that you feel my pain that I seen, it's best that we switch You take the fortune and fame and see if it's what you expected Take the money and change and be careful where you invest it Just take the test and don't stress it, you get stopped by a detective Tryin to get in your personal life, gotta do your best to protect it The answer rests in the message, when I go I go in a blaze But it won't be no Captain Save 'Em cause where I'm goin you saved Tryin to rain down on my parade 'til that umbrella get raised They thinkin that they can read me when they ain't nowhere my page Tryin to keep a smile on my face, even at times when I engage In business conversations with people I know are snakes It's like it's a piece of cake, part of the icing is venom Spend a lifetime tryin to bring me down, but I just ain't gonna let 'em You better tell 'em   Uhh, I'm back and forth and I'm pacin, bein more patient than patients Tryin to wait for the good news to show up but I'm unfortunately waitin Gotta be group participation if it's in the courts that we makin I was unfortunately done and she was unfortunately fakin Cause the only sexual spark is the spark he got for the dough They say 'til death do us part but that part is where she says no There are too many emotions, emotions like pins and needles Actin like emotions are evil like showin love is illegal I thought that it was a eagle but I seen this vulture befo' He thinks this is where I'll stop cause he sees that I'm walkin slow But no I think you should know that soon as I get where I go You'll remember the fact that I had a purpose for sho' I hope you know where you're goin, I hope you know that today On the side of the road you gon' see a whole lot of snakes When the bad weather comes to rain down on your parade Just raise up your umbrella and try to keep goin straight And keep on goin     This road has many curves, many bumps and potholes It can even take you through a loop if you ain't got yo' {shit} together, unpredictable weather could leave you Dehydrated, frostbitten, washed away or either Ran over by heavy traffic, watch where you roam Cause, it's a challenge just tryin to make it home But, still I walk, I keep my pace, I keep my stride Would hitchhike but there's too much pride I must find a narrow path so I can walk and laugh out loud Choir sing without bein judged by the crowd Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now I just beat my feet and get there someway, somehow And, mile after mile after mile I'll smile Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down And the road gets rough and the journey is long I might get tired but I must move on   Most of our heroes are locked up, diseased, or deceased You could never really feel remorse until somebody restin in peace You measure the best by success and ain't impressed by nothin less Only time we say we wanna change is when we ain't got no change left Only time we call on God is when there is nobody else to call Keep stumblin over the same roadblock that just made you fall We always gotta wait 'til somethin happen before we start reactin We at war with ourselves, how much longer are we gon' be attackin?  {*rainfall and thunder fades out*}"

If this was the NBA then you all woulda got a broom Woulda swept ya right out the series for copying other plays It worked for the other team, so you trying to throw up a trey I would empty the bench and replace all you clowns any day Who told you you could be Jesus Shuttleworth anyway? Think ya balling you Bynum, look at ya Andrew You tried to play all ya cards, look what ya hand drew Is it the love or the money, why you in the game fool? You can ball but the money won’t buy you an angle A loss I'mma hand you cause of the stupidness men do But see there’s an amount of stupidness that I can handle You should give an example. Everyone's an example Pure as a virgin until they get ran through  If ya hoping to see me miss Hoping to see me fail, hope that you get ya wish Those sleeping on me, should be sleeping on this Help you to make ya bed, help you to dig a ditch Those who never ever did anything on my list They can say what they want, they don’t even exist Hope that you keep my name off the tip of your bottom lip You can jump off a cliff, hope your parachute doesn’t fit Even some I respect would lose it all for a check And then not even get the check; reason to get upset I ain’t getting emotional, I'm just not being sociable Even though that’s what Nancy my publicist say I’m supposed to do Excuse me cause I don’t wanna do the interview They see through and I’m the one that got the inner view ""But Koopa how can you talk because we ain’t been hearing you?"" You know it always gets hotter after the winter's through They say you're a genius I say you're a Beavis, no pledging allegiance They’ll say you’re the meanest, but they don’t even mean it You know that they really gon' ride a wave of convenient I’m glad that everybody learned how to surf But I’m shark under that water that’s emerging to murk Fresh, like I’m allergic to dirt So when I kill em all I’ll try not to get blood on my shirt Every verse is a keeper, ain’t a price for a feature I just do it to do it, my pockets don’t really need ya If dissing is your procedure, promise you I’ll delete ya Trying to stay in my lane but you mention me and it’s ether  Yeah, I’ll set up your corpse You can go pick the artist, I’ll wet up the charts Never said I was perfect, I’m not better than y’all But if we talking about rapping, than not better is false If money talks what is your conversation Cause you show me you got a real lack of communication And rappers, I appreciate inspiration As long as they don’t confuse inspiration for imitation The thought or the implication of that would be blasphemous Snatch the words out the mouth of whoever vocab it is If that rapping is rap I’m unwrapping they packages Then I repackage it up just to show ya what rapping is Competition, we should start a petition For every person that’s still in a major label position Obvious that you idiots never paid for tuition You switched up the definition you calling that a musician? Listen I’m on a mission, so you just get in the car Voices all in my ear say ""try not to get involved"" Didn’t give me the option but I'mma get rid of ya The ill mind of Koopa is telling me ""kill 'em all"""

I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell Giving her soul to me, it's like an identity sell We never met is the story that my memory tells Telling me tales like she doesn't handle Hennessey well Getting into it, getting intimate and into details See, I just met you and you showing me your kids ""Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids"" Then who's in this picture, ""Man, let me show you just who it is""     Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel Knew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hang a Round this part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see She said she wasn't married but the ring on her finger Told me that she was lyin' and just using the same uhh Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you He told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you He said what he said with a passion like it was so true Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around To find that photo, I'm like ""Oh no there's some trouble in town"" I turn around to see two officers coming in now They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground So close that they can listen to either of us now We turn back around and then she says no need for whispering Then she tells me ""I don't really give a damn whose listening Try to make it last a long time was my mission And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him Hit 'em with my fist and them punches were never missing him""     Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how Wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile She said pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile as power Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower Damn what do you mean? I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him? She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him She stops then I say ''Ay keep talkin I'm listening'' I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing Henny spilling then she tell me For real and That the feeling that I was feeling is that I wanted to kill him Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villian Her voice was getting louder, the moral is getting clearer The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her Told me It was protection, Reached for it in the stash The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at last Baby I think you crazy, I'm sorry I'm pressing for time I gotta go grind, time’s been interesting Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing That this conversation is two types of evil confession She pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend How you know him? She told me that she was with him at his house Watching movies for Sundays when they be chilling And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him The feeling was the worst feeling she possibly could be feeling Stood up and then I yelled out ""Why the hell did you kill him?"" I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, she had sex with 'em and that's crazy"

When I know I can have some gangstas show up at your crib tonight Don't think you're invincible cause you're holding your pistol tight You pull a mac in my sight and I bet you won't live to type Careful of how I rep when I throw my set in the sky Living a life that's factual I never could live a lie A legacy lives forever, some Arabs just live to die So when the grim reaper try me im staring him in his eye I can't' put on a business tie that ain't really the way I hustle Ain't trying to scuff up the suit, negotiate with my knuckles Currency out in customs, euros inside the duffle Money I didn't declare I said ten but it's really double You touch it it's gon' be trouble noone touching my cash I'm welcoming any suckers and busters who wanna clash Just cause I put on the hoodie don't mean that I'm lower class We can discuss the future but that don't erase the past No stopping my vibrating keep on moving and shaking Brought more illegal hundreds through customs then immigration On the quest to be great and im probably gon' show up late When I'm leaving my lady waiting I call it anticipation Go ahead throw a stone if you feel it'll to entertain you Better hope that you miss don't be the one getting strangle They say that money can change you that depends on the angle Tell em how much it cost to get turn to a perfect angel She talking relationships and the exit to be complete Moved in to kiss the lips and I missed em' and kiss the cheek Generation confused they know that they can't compete Their movements ain't really movement I'm moving away from my seat They say stay away from the drama you probably could be Obama Just because how I dress they look at me like I'm Osama Interrogating you the asked the last time that I've seen my father Tell you that and you guessed it, the last time that I seen my mama  [Chorus} They say that it'll be alright but sometimes I kinda doubt it I admit that I doubt it Mhm they say that itll be alright but sometimes I kinda doubt it Mhm I admit that I doubt it  See that's how the conversation normally go, til you flip over the card and see the other side of the conversation Its always the wise man, the OG, giving you a little game in a calm voice sounding like...   See life is a game of chess try your best to not be the pawn Calculate every step make em kiss the ring of the don Every women you meet, treat her good as you treat your mom And I promise you'll end up with something beautiful on your arm Don't stress about no one else Treat your family just like your songs Calculate what you say They'll remember it when your gone Any question you get that ain't worthy then don't respond Let em think what they think just kill em all with your charm Killer pull out his heat and he daring you to reply? That speaking like you a chief or a sheriff will never fly Most people will hold the truth, they'll share it if its a lie But the truth is you really can't get embarrassed after you die Dont try to be Superman when you standing on kryptonite Think carefully when you speak, might help you to live tonight Don't think you're invincible cause you're holding your pistol tight You see a mac in your sight that don't mean you gon' live to skype Be thankful of every breath like you cherishing a supply You'll be a breath of fresh air, learn to humidify A legacy lives forever is probably the biggest lie Cause a legacy ain't gon' live if no one remembers you died Go put on a business tie gotta make em respect your hustle You can keep on them sneaks so they know you came up like Russel Currency out in customs, don't sneak it into your duffle It's money you didn't declare then them people gon' think your trouble You stacking and keep it suddle you can go make the cash Be careful of all the vultures and cultures that love to clash Just cause you wear a hoodie don't mean that your lower class We can go fix the future but that don't erase the past No hating your vibrating I know your moving and shaking But save it or later you'll look in your vault and see it's vacant On the quest to be great and I know you'll probably be late When you leaving your lady waiting just hope that she don't get taken Tired of finger pointing you doin what entertain you Remember its entertainment, not something that can sustain you They say that money will change you, never a perfect angel But angel and invest and hope that that lead to the perfect angle The women you give your rang to I hope that she never cheat She move in to kiss your lips, I just hope that kiss is sweet This generation confused ""what the hell is a twitter tweet?"" Your movement ain't really moving if doing it from your seat Stay away from the drama you could probably be Obama Dont act like we ever thought we would even see Obama I know you ain't seen your momma I know you ain't seen your father But just cause they dissapeared doesn't mean you gotta be a goner"
