/songs/423913,Disturbed,3,https://genius.com/Disturbed-3-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/423913,The Lost Children,2005-09-20," I often wonder why I sit and wait to die What have I done to justify the sentence they gave? Too many hours spent in darkness questioning... ""How and why""?   I can't remember many moments in the light This retribution has defiled me to no end An execution without merit looms ahead Tell me why! I was a boy who had to live his own way I never fit into the model they had designed I chose a path less taken I stood with others who had often felt the same We got stares from passersby Our dark attire seemed to frighten people away And when the three young boys died They pointed fingers and entangled us in a lie! No hope in sight   I sit here terrified! Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? Won't anybody open up their eyes? Before the three of us have lost our lives!   Why was everybody so damn afraid? They blamed the devil for the heinousness of the crime And to justify their own faith We were labeled pawns of Satan for a time The three of us were attacked and disgraced For many hours we were questioned and someone lied One of us couldn't take it His simple manner was manipulated in kind Fear made him lie   Now I am terrified! Can't someone try to bring the truth to light? Won't anybody open up their eyes? Before the three of us have lost our lives! And why? Can't anybody see through their disguise?! Only believe we didn't take their lives! And now the three of us have lost our lives  "

Pain left me numb Far too many times To celebrate this death I never will forget And we spoke Oh so many times And words we never said Are the ones I most regret   Is he already gone?

Can't face it anymore, it's eating me alive   I'm not able to recognize Where does the answer lie? You're no longer the same Is there nothing more that I can do?   Who! Who! Who the hell are you? Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?   You were someone in whom I could confide (Ah! Ah!) But you pushed me further away with every single lie You used to have a soul, but it has surely died (Ah!) What happened? When did you turn to the other side?   No longer able to recognize For every word's a lie You are forever changed Ant there's nothing more that I can do   Who! Who! Who the hell are you? Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?    Oh!   You and I, we were once so... You and I, it was once incredible You and I, we were once so... You and I, we were indivisible You and I were once two of a kind Where did all your innocence go? Now I wonder how it happened That you and I, we were once so... You and I, we were once inseparable You and I, we were once like Gemini It was undeniable You and I, we were once two of a kind Where did my deliverance go? Can there be amend to this divide?   I'm not able to recognize Where does the answer lie? You're no longer the same Is there nothing more that I can do?   Who! Who! Who the hell are you? Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?   (Where does the answer lie? Where does the answer lie? It is eating me alive) Who! Who! Who the fuck are you? (Where does the answer lie? Where does the answer lie? It is eating me alive) Who! Who! Who the fuck are you? Who! Who! Who the fuck are you? Who! Who! Who the fuck are you?"

Why do I deserve this? So we're different Why do I deserve to die now? Give my a reason why?   Then it all goes a blur Let instinct take flight Find my hands on his throat Yet hear myself say   Tell me now, who taught you how to hate? Because it isn't in your blood Not a part of what you're made So let this be understood Somebody taught you how to hate When you live this way, you become Dead to everyone   A father's pride, my son walking beside me I look around and marvel how the children play In perfect disarray (So innocent) No judgement, pure exhilaration Black to white, the colors aren't on their minds Nothing predefined (All different) There's always one who plants an evil seed and Preaches fear to pull you to the other side Into a world of lies   Everything is unsure when you've lost your sight Can there still be a cure? What made you this way?    (You're not anyone)  Oh!   Lost all innocence Infected and arrogant You burn all your life (There's no telling you) No deliverance Consumed by the pestilence Of hate, you're denied Deep in your heart does it still remain? Do you think you can bring it Back to life again? Is it still in your soul? (No saving you) Where's the deviant The unholy revenant That has made you this way? Made you fall for this hate   Tell me now, who taught you how to hate? Because it isn't in your blood Not a part of what you're made So let this be understood Somebody taught you how to hate When you live this way, you become (You become)   Tell me now, who taught you how to hate? Because it isn't in your blood Not a part of what you're made So let this be understood Somebody taught you how to hate When you live this way, you become (You become) Dead to everyone (You're not anyone)"
