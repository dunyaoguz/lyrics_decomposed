Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party Next they wash my body as a team And they say ""Foo, your royal penis is clean!""

I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I Own property from California to the Hamptons and I Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah I check to see how my album's doing today The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey I gotta party, man, that's how I live So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like   Yes, it's on and poppin' Yes, this party's rockin' Yes, the cutie's shockin' Yes and there ain't no stopppin' Yes, it's on and poppin' Yes, this party's rockin' Yes, the cutie's shockin' Yes and there ain't no stopppin' Yes, it's on and poppin' Yes, this party's rockin' Yes, the cutie's shockin' Yes and there ain't no stopppin' Yes, it's on and poppin' Yes, this party's rockin' Yes, the cutie's shockin' Yes and there ain't no stopppin'  Every day I see my dream Every day I see my-every day I see my dream Every day I see my dream Ev-ev-every day I see my dream Every day I see my-every day I see my dream Every day I see my dream"
