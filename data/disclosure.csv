Have I already blown it?   Somehow in my head, it's overgrown It's made me question everything I know Did what you say contain an undertone? It goes on and on and on   It keeps turning up, it won't leave me Our time together become too short Did I say enough? Speak freely Did my words destroy? Or was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought? Oh, was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought? Was it just an afterthought?   When you're so hard to read I wonder what you're hiding Lying under the leaves I'm not someone you confide in   Somehow in my head, it's overgrown It's made me question everything I know Did what you say contain an undertone? It goes on and on and on   It keeps turning up, it won't leave me Our time together become too short Did I say enough? Speak freely Did my words destroy? Or was it just an afterthought?
