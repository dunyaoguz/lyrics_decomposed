I'm a tell you what happened from where he left off. I get a call. Doc say ""you gotta meet my cousin, he on his way up to see you."" I said ""alright man, tell him to meet me over here at [?]. I was at [?], I think [?]'s mall, [?] plaze or something. So me, Doe, Frank White. And Frank said to me ""alright, what we need to do to get out of Montgomery, Alabama. I say ""well a...if you look around man you'll see that you already done made it out of Montgomery, Alabama. We ain't [?] enough man. You guys done did a pretty good job so far, already  We sat here man, you know, we sat here for about an hour. Then we went out to the truck man, Doe playing some unreleased music so. I sat there and I said, ""so y'all really got something huh?"" From that day forward, I admire Doe because as a young man, the age that he was he always presented himself to be more mature. It’s very rare that you find somebody at the age of 20, 21 and sit them down, in front of you know, someone I guess, they aspire to be like. And they are as composed, they're poised and posture like and looking, eye with this person, like you know, I got the same ability and the same talent, and the same potential to be on the level that you are right now. It's very rare that you find that somebody the age of 20, 21 and you could walk them into a room with a Nelly, or you could walk them into a room with a Timbaland or Jay Z, and they not lose their cool, they’re composed, postured, with the morals, the standards, and the principles that were instilled in him from his family: his mom, his dad, grand-mama, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles. He walked like these people are watching him all the time. You know what I'm saying? Like he had people to answer to, so he can't carry himself nothing less than. Know what I'm saying? And I saw that in him day one, off the top, and that is what drew me to him even more so beyond the music  Over here at Hustle Gang, we have a host of artists. All of them know that I tell them ‘listen, your talent is only going to get you so far’. It’s the things that you learn, the things that you are able to do outside of the booth, is what's going to separate you from the rest. I said the same thing to Glen. He never left the studio… he said ‘I’d rather be here than the club, simply because I know this is going to pay off.' Remarks like that man, it was extremely rare to hear a man, at a young age, speak in that manner. Over here man, a lot of people look at us like a record company. A lot of people look at us like a entertainment house. To be honest with you, this is a family, this is a family business. I will never let his life be lived in vain. All of my resources, all of my relationships, all of my efforts, all of my energy will be put forth to make sure that his dream lives on. And I speak on behalf of myself, I speak on behalf of the entire Grand Hustle, Hustle Gang family. I speak on behalf of Blueprint. I speak on behalf of anybody who got any love for me. Show some love for Doe B. Love"

A bullseye for bitchest throwin' they pussy at me? I respect us too much to stand to see you sad I'd rather let you go and find the man you never had Arguments and ""I'm sorry"" that we ain't bothered to say Just made it harder to remember why we bothered to stay How can the good outweigh when we fight everyday Remember I used to be the nigga who would brighten your day? And you used to say ""I miss you, wish I could've saw you today"" Now if I call you, you know all I gotta say is Do you really want me, baby? Cause I want you Do you really want me, baby? Cause I want you You can catch me in the Maybach Laid back, puffin' on the finest tree Or chillin' with two or three chicks That could crush a nigga's top ten picks With ease, darlin' Even though my pimp hand is strong My patience is long And I'd give it all up just to see you in them thongs One more time, baby One more time, darlin' Do you really want me, baby? Cause I want you Do you really want me, baby? Cause I want you Now let me tell you somethin' I know I ain't your first And you won't be my last Understand, but still, if we gonna make this thing work We gotta put the past in the past And leave it there You leave it Do you really want me?"

Late nights, gun fights, high speed chases So close to the good life we tasted Damn the consequences pimp, if it's a chance we'd take it First case a month in juvenile and get probation When I think about all we done It's amazin to see how far we've come Remember?   We started small time, dope game hustlin that cocaine Interstate traffickin, high feelin no pain Numb to the fact that we was poisonin our own kind I ain't give a fuck, he gettin his so I want mine Young'n with that attitude, somebody finna give me that I ain't give a fuck, how I got it, it was real as that So if I had to peel a cap, somebody was dead then Since I'm a killer that's the condition my head's in Can't work too hard to get my money, I refuse to Slave for the next man who raised nigga, fuck you! These streets are 9-to-5, you want it we can get it for ya And even though they steady changin this is still a hustle Still got them same rules, may not be the same game We done found some brand new money, still we maintain The same integrity we upheld in the street light Livin a motherfuckin dream nigga singin like   w/ Scarface ad libs"

With them big ol' thighs after school? Jay 305 had gave me high five When I said I’m in hot pursuit You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive A new Monte Carlo that cruise And that shot my pride, I tried to improv But no freestyle I never do You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee Hol' up, that pussy petty Yeah, your nails did, your hair did Your cell phone is selfish It only got numbers that come with a Hummer Her new prima donna I smelt it Tried to make you mine, ho! Tried to make some time, ho! But I ain’t got the time or the patience To stop and wait in line, ho! Her dreams holds Versace She fall for Armani Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney! I’m grown now, I’m on my own now I’m po-o-o-oppin' Change my phone now when I get home now I got o-o-o-options Fast forward, wait, is that you? With them big ol' thighs after school? And your three kids and three baby daddies Same car note that’s overdue? I know   When the lights go out And I'm in my bed I think of all the madness in my head All of the things that I did back then When I'm in my bed I think of all the memories I've had All of the things I did back then"

God damn nigga Might as well gon' and go to hell nigga Cause I tried as hard as I can nigga I know you only a man but God damn nigga   They don't scare negros today with no badge, or no white skin, or no white sheet, or no white anything else. They police the same way, they put their club upside your head and then turn around and accuse you of attacking them. Every case of police brutality against a negro follows the same pattern --- they attack you, bust you all upside your mouth and then take you to court and charge you with assault.
