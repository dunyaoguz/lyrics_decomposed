Who has the list? Has this all been uber fate? Is every move a known footprint fossilized A rare remake realized? And if you fall too soon I'll carry you  And I know that I have it all in the same way as you do But we all take a unique fall in the final scene To a violin string Or a crashing train In the pounding rain And the thunder rolls in And the vertigo comes and goes And comes and goes and comes We each need somebody to teach us How to be carried"
