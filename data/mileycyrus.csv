I don't know, 'cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow   We only have 1 sun, 1 moon 1 me, 1 you And we only have a little time to show how much we love The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon) How much I really love you And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)   Wake up, world Can't you see the earth is crying? Wake up, world Can't you see all the clouds are dying? And maybe one day there won't be rainbows Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue I don't wanna see a cyclone There's no sun, no moon No me, no you   We only have 1 sun, 1 moon 1 me, 1 you And we only have a little time to show how much we love The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon) How much I really love you And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)"

C'est là que je formule le vœu, sans concession, de partir à la nage avec les poissons L'été tout entier est censé être aussi chaud ?
