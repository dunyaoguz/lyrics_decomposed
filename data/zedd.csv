Feel like the world is over, don't know why I've been created I've been under pressure but nevertheless I know nothing can measure Feeling outdated, everybody inebriated Feel like I'm automated, I'm automated, I'm automated No, never faded, but debated, a visionary that made it As it escalated, I elevated and feel like I raided the game Cause all of this, it just sounded the same in my mind   We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (Never, ever) Hold on to someone close, friend Cause you're never too young You're never too young, you're never too young to die Remember the ghosts before you And drink to their souls tonight And don't forget what they told you You're never too young You're never too young, you're never too young to die (Die)   You're never too young You're never too young Never, never You're never too young You're never too young Never, never Never, never Never, never Never, never No, you're never too young Never, never Never, never Never, never (oh) Never, never Yeah Never to young Never to young Never to young to die   We're smart enough to know that no one gets out alive (Never, ever) Hold on to someone close, friend Cause you're never too young You're never too young, you're never too young to die Remember the ghosts before you And drink to their souls tonight And don't forget what they told you You're never too young You're never too young, you're never too young to die"

Pulling back the reins, letting go again I'm not afraid, I'm not   All my life, one page at a time I'll show you my, my true colors No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes Let me show you my, my true colors It ain't no rainbow   A promise with a lie is broken by design What I thought I knew Has been swallowed by the truth It's time to light the flame Right before it rains I'm not afraid, I'm not   All my life, one page at a time I'll show you my, my true colors No no no, I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes Let me show you my, my true colors, it ain't no rainbow   Something tells me I know nothing at all We've escaped our capture Yet we have our masters And somehow it's like I've waited   All my life, one page at a time I'll show you my, my true colors And no, and no I won't apologize for the fire in my eyes Let me show you my My true colors, it ain't no rainbow"
