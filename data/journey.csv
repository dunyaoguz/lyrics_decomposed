Once you let someone love you You will find out an open door A place in your heart you have never been before Believe it's never too late For someone to set you free Once you let someone love you (Someone love you) You can go back to where you have been Are you ready to try again?   Once you let someone love you You will find out an open door A place in your heart you've never been before Believe it's never too late For someone to set you free Once you let someone love you (Someone love you) Once you let someone love you (Someone love you)"
