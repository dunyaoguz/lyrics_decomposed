How do I live? How do I breathe? When you're not here I'm suffocating I wanna feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up? For you I have to risk it all Cause the writing's on the wall   A million shards of glass That haunt me from my past As the stars begin to gather And the light begins to fade When all hope begins to shatter Know that I won't be afraid   If I risk it all Could you break my fall?   How do I live? How do I breathe? When you're not here I'm suffocating I wanna feel love, run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up? For you I have to risk it all Cause the writing's on the wall   The writing's on the wall   How do I live? How do I breathe? When you're not here I'm suffocating I wanna feel love, run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up? How do I live? How do I breathe? When you're not here I'm suffocating I wanna feel love run through my blood Tell me is this where I give it all up? For you I have to risk it all Cause the writing's on the wall"
