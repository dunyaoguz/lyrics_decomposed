This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much"

Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy See that was a segue, I believe the matter Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing And if you planning family vacations you better know when But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!   Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one But just wait, nah mean, take it slow   Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"" Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second I get her number she tells me to call her after this session And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!   Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right Uh, ya man, it's what it is   And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town And stupid me I just listen to her Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed When we were together it seeming like way back when Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime   I miss you, most of all, my darling  (give me a second to gather my thoughts)  Strolling in the park (Ho!) And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man) (Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?) Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing (I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss) (Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)   I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup So we can get back to them cognac nights With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild The winter came and blew his cold air through Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her By the end of the week I would know that crew And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen But this Summer is different it's a two man operation Granted the fact that we one man short Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' The face, the breast, the bras, the toes I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside We'll never talk again, scary and true That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit And when they talk about they past and lovers And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive   Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring"

Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...   I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love   Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?   I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love   Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it 'Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?   I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you?

Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom And they recognize the bathroom All hell starts to break loose in my texts I only tell lies to who I gotta protect I would rather have you remember me how we met I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step That ain't what I'm 'bout I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?

I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die What you got, time on your hands or time on your side? Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high? Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai? Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties And all of these fortunate times And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size? Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find? Like healin' my soul, like family time Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive? Is there more?

You know how sticky these situations get You go up higher than me some days You know what I think we could be some day Let me at least show you my side of things, man Aw, man, aw, man, aw, man"

I can relate to kids going straight to the league When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed And that's around the time That your idols become your rivals You make friends with Mike But got to A.I. him for your survival Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment That you take for granted, you can thank me now And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them Cause they think that I can help them Get back to where they fell from But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life That's how you know it's going down In case another chance never comes around   You could thank me now, go 'head Thank me later, yeah I know what I said But later doesn't always come so instead It's okay, you could thank me now   Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic Man, the good girls went silent on me They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me But do I ever come up in discussion Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins? Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question? I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul But those same ones from your area will grow into women That are ready to get married at hello Because of what they allowed, where are they all now? I know they're somewhere watching So I'm trying to make them proud Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree? They say the doors will open up Soon as you find the missing key That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded And the bandwagon's full But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown And I know life is just a game In which the cards are facing down I'm in a world where things are taken, never given How long they choose to love you will never be your decision And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen So while I'm still here in this position   You could thank me now, go 'head Thank me later, yeah I know what I said But later doesn't always come so instead It's okay, you could thank me now"

Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Toronto's true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else 😂. Thank you for reminding me that we set out to do something more than just have the biggest song in the club or the biggest song of the month. Thank you for building SOTA. Thank you for caring about the people in this city as much as I do. Thank you for a lifetime of hard work and surreal moments. This story would have gone a lot different without you. Thank you 40 (aka DB40 aka Cuarenta aka Bibber aka My brother). Text me when you are ready to start the next one 😂😂😂  @ovo40

I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it I mean, how could I forget?

I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead Uh-huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up I'm trying to do better than good enough   What am I afraid of? This is supposed to be what dreams are made of But people I don't have the time to hang with Always look at me and say the same shit They say ""You promised me you would never change"" ""You promised me you would never change""   Am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on? When 40 got some shit for me to snap on, now that I'm on I don't really want to worry about getting back on I'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home And I be acting like I don't know how to work a phone But hit ""redial"", you'll see that I just called Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected Texted saying she wished she would have kept it The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it Man, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is I'm holding on by a thread It's like I'm high right now, the guy right now And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now That nothing really comes as a surprise right now Cause we just having the time of our lives right now   What am I afraid of?
