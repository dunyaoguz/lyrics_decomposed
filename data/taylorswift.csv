Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space.""  ""Nice to meet you, where you been?

To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you're NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless   1.

How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together  I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  ""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:  Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i  Na na na na waiting at the back door They're around and the vultures come around And you know that they won't, they won't us Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us And you come and sing and listen I would not think about it but I'm not done Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I  Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes And guns They are the hunters we are the foxes And we run  Baby, I know places we won't be found And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down Cause I, I know places we can hide I know places, I know places  Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places  Or whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing"

This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:  Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this  It's 2 am, in your car Windows down, past my street the memories start It's in the past You drive straight ahead You thinking that I hate you now Cause you still don't know what I never said  I wish you would come back Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I wish you knew that  Do you like it!?"

/songs/2455126,Taylor Swift,Red [Liner Notes],https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-red-liner-notes-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/2455126,Red,2012-10-22,"Foreword  There's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says ""love is so short, forgetting is so long."" It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.  My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red. 1. State Of Grace Hidden message: I love you doesn't count after goodbye  2.

It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009."

/songs/472578,Taylor Swift,The Future of Music Is a Love Story,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-future-of-music-is-a-love-story-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/472578,None,2014-07-07,"Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?  Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive  There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently  In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it  Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art  Arrows Through the Heart  In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us  There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past  However, some artists will be like finding ""the one."" We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon  I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say ""shock""; I said ""surprise."" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?  In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be  There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento ""kids these days"" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be ""how many followers you have on Instagram.""  Fan Power  A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around  Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool  This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all  Celebrity Spotlight  I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, ""It was never this crazy for us back then!"" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to  And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism  And I'd also like a nice garden"

I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud   Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me?

Yeah, and I don't know what to say Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now   And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?

I don't want to lose your face And I don't want to wake one day And not remember what time erased And I don't want to turn around Because I’m not scared Of what love gave me and took away And I don't want to lose your face   I've got a picture of you in my bedroom And I hope it never falls And I hope I never lose that feeling I used to get when you would call And now I wonder to myself Who were you and where are you? Were you ever here at all?   That girl in the song had it so good I wish I could close my eyes and see you I wish the sky had your face And the oceans had your eyes And the sunset had your lips And I had you
