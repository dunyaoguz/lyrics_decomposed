You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired And I feel so all alone   I gave her to you (I don't need a toy) I thought you might appreciate (I don't like the way that it moves) The way that she dances The painted look upon her face (Someone must've thrown this away) She must have come from the sun (I got too much stuff) I want to take her through the park Where she'd tell me I'm all that she wants (Speaking of which) If she could even talk (I think we need to talk)   I feel so all alone No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke How do you cry with inanimate eyes? You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired And I feel so all alone I feel so all alone   As she sits on my shelf It makes me think of you The way she carries the things that remind me of who We used to be before we became antiques She's a lot like you But when I hold her too tight, I know she'll break She just takes some glue to stay   And I feel so all alone No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke How do you cry with inanimate eyes? You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired And I feel so all alone I feel so all alone I feel so all alone"

One night, you were out I was inside feeling sorry for myself I drank from any bottle I could find I broke into your room I tried on all your clothes And I read every note   So what the fuck happened to us? What the fuck happened to us? We used to be something - I can't remember just what   We were born into the chandeliers like troubadours and saints I said, ""I don't mind if it takes time, I just wanna get away"" I wanna take her back to all the day when we were staying back I'd lay my head upon your lap, I hope you never take it back To my surprise, well, all those pages were bled white I stand corrected and relieved, drunk and uncomfortable in heels I suppose that it makes sense you'd never run and tell your friend Oh, that you left too soon Found me dolled up in your room - I know just what you'd say   If I could name just one thing that's gonna haunt me That's gonna bleed me dry, that's gonna bruise It'd have to be the look upon your face when Nattie came to pick you up, take you away And you just stood there in the hall waiting for me to call it off  What kind of selfish piece of shit would base a life on no regrets? Would let the only one who ever understood me walk alone? And I closed the door I made it halfway down your hall Then something caught my eye and I fell apart  Well, there's a picture on your dresser drawer And it doesn't even look like me But I swear to God, when the bulbs went off I wish we could have shined forever I was there in the suit you made You were beautiful, it was your birthday And only for a night, we believed in magic  Well do you remember when I woke you up to tell you I love you? Said do you remember when I woke you up to tell you I love you?    And I still do   What the fuck happened to us? What the fuck happened to us? What the fuck happened to us?  "

Or go on, go on, go on If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come Why am I the one always packing up my stuff? For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?   She got enough on her mind That she feel no sorrow I let my fate fill the air So now she rollin down the window Never been one to hold on But I need a last breath So I ask if she remembers when She used to come and visit me We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong   Go on, go on, go on If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come Why am I the one always packing up my stuff? For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong Why am I the one always packing up my stuff? I think I kinda like it But I might have had too much   I'll move back down to this western town When they find me out make no mistake about it I'll move back down to this western town When they find me out make no mistake about it I'll move back down to this western town   Or go on, go on, go on If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  Go on, go on, go on If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?  For once, for once, for once I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?   I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much I'll move back down  When I see stars, that's all they are When I hear a song When I see stars, that's all they are When I hear a song When I see stars, that's all they are When I see stars, that's all they are When I hear a song"
