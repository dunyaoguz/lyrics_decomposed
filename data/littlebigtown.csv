Well, it was double beds With a kitchenette Bedspreads of sea-foam green It was sunburns and taking turns On boogie boards we'd bring Even if we spent every single cent to stay across the street We went to the beach   We mowed a few yards I filled a coffee can with some Benjamins Just a couple of friends Barely seventeen And we went to the beach And in the middle of March Before real life starts Partied so hard We could hardly remember a thing It was PBRs and tiki bars Don't take my fake I.D It was cigarettes, girls we just met And making out on lifeguard seats And those polaroids of me and the boys is all the proof I need And we went to the beach   Girl, don't you hate to leave It's been one hell of a week It was a vow, to you too, ""I do."" Babe, can you believe? It was brand new tans Brown-golden bands Of sand all in the sheets If I know you and me, we only get one of these And we went to the beach   We went to the beach We went to the beach We went to the beach"

All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed   On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame A letter I started but I didn't know what to say No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now   Tell me how, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed   Aren't you even going to make a sound? Your side of the bed Turn the other way when I turn the lights down Your side of the bed Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?   How, how'd you get so far away? All we have left are the memories of the love we made Are you sleeping with your own regret? On your side of the bed   On your side of the bed Are you still awake, on your side of the bed"
