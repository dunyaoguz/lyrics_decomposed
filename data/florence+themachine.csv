How does it feel? And pulled out all your stitches Hubris is a bitch A hundred arms, a hundred years A hundred arms, a hundred years   And then it's just too much The streets, they still run with blood A hundred arms, a hundred years You can always find me here And, Lord, don't let me break this Let me hold it lightly Give me arms to pray with Instead of ones that hold too tightly, yeah"

Would you have it any other way? You couldn't have it any other way   Because she’s a cruel mistress And a bargain must be made But oh, my love, don’t forget me While I let the water take me   Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow  So lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow"
