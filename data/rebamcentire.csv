So I've been busy with feet astir Strewing my shop with branches of fern The table is spread and the kettle is shined And over the rafters the holly is twined Now I'll wait for my Lord to appear And listen closely so I will hear His step as He nears my humble place And I'll open the door and look on His face So his friends went home and left Conrad alone For this was the happiest day he had known For long since, his family had passed away And Conrad had spent many a sad Christmas Day But he knew with the Lord as his Christmas Guest This Christmas would be the dearest and best So he listened with only joy in his heart And with every sound he would rise with a start And look for the Lord to be at his door Like the vision he had had a few hours before So he ran to the window after hearing a sound But all he could see on the snow covered ground Was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn And all of his clothes were ragged and worn But Conrad was touched and he went to the door And he said, ""You know, your feet must be frozen and sore I have some shoes in my shop for you And a coat that will keep you warmer too."" So with grateful heart the man went away But Conrad noticed the time of day And wondered what made the Lord so late And how much longer he'd have to wait When he heard a knock, he ran to the door But it was only a stranger once more A bent old lady with a shawl of black With a bundle of kindling piled on her back She asked for only a place to rest But that was reserved for Conrad's Great Guest But her voice seemed to plead ""Don't send me away Let me rest for awhile on Christmas Day"" So Conrad brewed her a steaming cup And told her to sit at the table and sup But after she left he was filled with dismay For he saw that the hours were slipping away And the Lord hadn't come as he said he would Then Conrad felt sure he had misunderstood When out of the stillness he heard a cry 'Please help me and tell me where am I?"" So again he opened his friendly door And stood disappointed as twice before It was only a child who'd wandered away And was lost from her family on Christmas Day Again Conrad's heart was heavy and sad But he knew he should make the little girl glad So he called her in and he wiped her tears And quieted all her childish fears Then he led her back to her home once more But as he entered his own darkened door He knew the Lord was not coming today For the hours of Christmas had passed away So he went to his room and knelt down to pray And he said ""Dear Lord, why did you delay? What kept you from coming to call on me? For I wanted so much your face to see.' When soft in the silence a voice he heard ""Lift up your head for I kept my word Three times my shadow crossed your floor And three times I came to your lonely door I was the beggar with bruised, cold feet And I was the woman you gave something to eat I was the child on the homeless street Three times I knocked, and three times I came in And each time I found the warmth of a friend Of all the gifts, love is the best And I was honored to be your Christmas Guest"

With a gun! No you can't get a man with a gun If I went to battle with someone's herd of cattle You'd have steak when the job was done But if I shot the herder They'd holler bloody murder! And you can't get a hug from a mug with a slug Oh, you can't get a man with a gun  I'm cool, brave and darin' To see a line a-blarin' when I'm out with my Remmington But a look from a mister Will raise a fever blister Oh, you can't get a man with a gun  The gals with umbrellers Are always out with fellers In the rain or the blazing sun But a man never traffles with gals who carry rifles Oh, you can't get a man with a gun  With a gun! With a gun! No you can't get a man with a gun A Tom, Dick, or Harry Will build a house for Carrie when the preacher has made 'em one But he can't build ya houses with buckshot in his trousers And you can't shoot a man in the tail like a quail Oh, you can't get a man with a gun  A man's love is mighty He'll even buy a nighty for a gal who he thinks is fun But they don't by pajamas for pistol-packin' mamas! Oh, a man may be hot, but he's not When he's shot! Oh you can't get a man with a gun!"
