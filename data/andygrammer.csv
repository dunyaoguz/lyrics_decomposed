When the dreams and the drums start rocking Can we dance with our knees not knocking? Not knocking, no See, I, I want a lady I can put stock in I want a bass and back beat to lock in I wanna know real love's not forgotten, not forgotten   Sayin', ""Ohh, na na na na na"" Singing out, ""Ohh ohh"""

The world is yours, the world is yours"

I I never thought I would be questioning the one I One I love   But here we are Rapped up in silence Can we Sound the alarm? Most of it fighting I don't Know where to start I keep colliding with the one I One I love   Don't make it so hard for me to stay You should know better than that   And before You go on breaking my heart And I fall Even deeper in love And my lungs Screaming out ""can you hear me?"" You should know better than that  Here we are Here we are Whoa   If I could leave I would be leaving cuz I Cannot believe What I am hearing tell me How can it be? I'm second-guessing on the one I One I love    Here we are Here we are Whoa Here we are Here we are Again   Some forgive just to forget I've not forgotten yet I still believe in you But there's a crack in our cement This time it's permanent Permanent  You should know You should know better than that    And here we are Here we are Whoa And here we are Here we are Again  You should know better than that  And here we are Here we are Whoa And here we are Here we are Again  You should know better than that"
