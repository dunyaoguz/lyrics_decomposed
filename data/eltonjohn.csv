Forcing us to move and they're the hardest things we've done They're easy, so easy  And though I'll think about him 'Til the earth draws in around me And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above It's easy, it's easy as life It's easy as life It's easy as life!"

What kind of words are these to hear from Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?  I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child I can't stay to see you die along with my tribe's pride I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run  Trampling down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in the sand Those who wish to follow me I welcome with my hands I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead  Now there seems no reason why I should carry on In this land that once was my land, I can't find a home It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns  And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole"
