City governments are eternally napping Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse  And bullets that scar souls with dark holes Get more than your car stole Some hearts be blacker than charcoal For real, this society's deprivation depends Not on our differences, but the separation within  No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid Tragedy within a parade The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague I'm the forgotten   In the memory you'll find me Eyes burning up The darkness holding me tightly Until the sun rises up"

They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away It's ironic, at times like this you'd pray But a bomb blew the mosque up, yesterday  There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads Inside your market, your shops, your clothes My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know But enough pride inside not to let that show  My brother had a book he would hold with pride A little red cover with a broken spine on the back He hand-wrote a quote, inside ""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""  Meanwhile, the leader just talks away Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay The rest of the world watching, at the end of the day Both scared and angry, like ""What did he say?""

I use the deadwood to make the fire rise The blood of innocence burning in the skies I filled my cup with the rising of the sea And poured it out in an ocean of debris  I'm swimming in the smoke Of bridges I have burned So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve What I don't deserve  I held my breath as clouds began to form But you were lost in the beating of the storm But in the end we were meant to be apart Like separate chambers of the human heart  I'm swimming in the smoke Of bridges I have burned So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve  It's in the blackened bones Of bridges I have burned So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve What I don't deserve  I'm swimming in the smoke Of bridges I have burned So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve  The blame is mine alone For bridges I have burned So don't apologize I'm losing what I don't deserve  What I don't deserve What I don't deserve What I don't deserve  I use the deadwood to make the

a student of the game that they taught me Rocking every stage in every place that they brought me I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it And so it ain't mistaken I'm gonna state it for the record I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak Opposite of slack synonym of heat Synonym of crack, closest to a beat Far from a punk Ya'll ought to stop talking and start trying to catch up
