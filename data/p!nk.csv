Are you a heartbreaker? Maybe you want me for the ride What if I'm falling for a heartbreaker?

He wrote it back in Vietnam about 40 years ago, and I grew up singing it with him at different Vietnam Vet functions. It's how I learned to harmonize and how to love an acoustic guitar, and the way that we recorded it; it was my Dad's first time in a recording studio, and he always said ""singers don't really have to work too hard"" - and he changed his mind that day. But we did it live, him and I in the vocal booth together, him playing and singing and me harmonizing. One take, straight through. It was a really, really good time, it was really special to be able to record a song with my Dad, the first song I ever learned. We hope you like it and we dedicate it to all the Vets out there   I have seen the rain I have felt the pain I don't know where I'll be tomorrow I don't know where I'm going I don't even know where I've been But I know, I'd like to see them again   Spend my days just searching Spend my nights in dreams Stop looking over my shoulder baby I've stopped wondering what it means Drop out, burn out, soldier home Oh, they've said I should've been more Probably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war   I have seen the rain I've survived the pain Oh, I've been home 30 years or so And I'm just stepping off of the plane   Spend my days just searching Spend my nights in dreams Stop looking over my shoulder baby I've stopped wondering what it means Drop out, burn out, soldier home Oh, they've said I should've been more Probably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war   We have seen the rain, together We've survived the pain, forever Oh, it's good to home again Its good to be with my friends Oh, it's good to be home again It's good to feel that rain"
