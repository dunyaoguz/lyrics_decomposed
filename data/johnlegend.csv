And we're doing it again Yes we're doing it again Oh we're doing it again We said it would end but Here it goes again  Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain Saying things will change, you'll take away the pain Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me You envelope me, you feel good as hell to me One moment leads to another few Here it goes again oh Oh leaving you is oh so hard to do I just can't pretend, can't pretend I keep doing it again, oh I'm doing it again Yes I'm doing it again I said it would end, oh,oh, oh Oh I'm doing it again I said it would end, oh,oh, oh Oh I'm doing it again I said it would end but here it goes again Again"

I wonder where she ran off to I miss my baby so I'm calling but I can't get through Please tell that girl if you meet her That someone's longing to see her Where did my baby go? I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)   I'm searching for the lover I knew Have you seen her? Where did she go? Feels like I've just lost my only friend Flames subsided, colors faded Love just got so complicated Wish that I could see her smile again So if you see her out there, tell her I'm still here Waiting for the day when she will reappear   Where did my baby go? I wonder where she ran off to I miss my baby so I'm calling but I can't get through Please tell that girl if you meet her That someone's longing to see her Where did my baby go? I wish that she would get back soon (get back soon)   Maybe I was wrong and I Ignored her for too long and I Didn't even notice when she slipped away Maybe while I lay fast asleep then Out into the night she creeps I'll leave the light on, so she'll come back someday So if you see her out there, tell her it's not fair That life's just not the same when she's not here   Where did my baby go? I wonder where she ran off to I miss my baby so I'm calling but I can't get through Please tell that girl if you meet her That someone's longing to see her Where did my baby go?
