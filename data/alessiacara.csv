As we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound? Is he proud? Are we proud? Guess we forgot how to live a life with no filter Making boring people famous Let's pretend they're fascinating Let's tell little girls that pretty girls are better Or that pigment or religion really matters   We're in some trouble Mr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen At least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV   Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs I know you're tuning in up there, way up there Would you care to answer my question? Oh, the land of poor taste The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days   Does he hang his head at all the greed that we possess? As the anti-social media perpetuates the mess Maybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the loose ends Stressed like the rest of us, it happens to the best of us God, or is it Mr. G to me? I hope that through the static, you’ll show us the clarity 'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet Wonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep Do you sleep in peace?   'Cause we're in some trouble Mr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen At least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good TV   Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs I know you're tuning in up there, way up there Would you care to answer my question? Oh, the land of poor taste The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days   Don't touch the remote, we'll be back in a moment We are not hopeless, we are just coping The mayhem is rolling, but it ain't showbiz Reality's potent, chaotic, I know it But we're growing, have some hope in us And were we worth all the time you gave up?   Oh, Mr. Man Upstairs I know you're tuning in up there, way up there Would you care to answer my question? Oh, the land of poor taste The spectacle of cut and paste that we've made Would you say, please say it was worth the seven days Yeah, oh, oh"

Cause I've been laying here Learning what the memories won't do See I need you and baby I need to Let down my guard and give you my scars Open up my heart   We could be stars... We could be stars... We could be stars...   Rap on my window, come home It's been a while, so stick around Why don't you? 'Til the end of time Say that you'll be mine An uphill climb fighting what the heart Really wants to do See I need you And sometimes we need to Shed our facade and be just who we are All broken and torn, then we could be stars   Oh we could be stars... We could be stars... We could be stars...   Piercing lights in the dark Make the galaxy ours Kingdom right where we are Shining bright as a morning You'll never be lonely Just promise you'll love me I'm never too far And we'll never part And we could be stars   Oh we could be stars... We could be stars... Oh we could be stars...   Just find  way to get home There's a space in my heart Open arms for you to run to Baby close your eyes and take the leap To make believe in fairytales I'll meet you there Oh yea, I'll fall too See I've wanted you here All along but my fear Just keeps haunting me won't let me go So it's hard to say I love you   We could be stars...
