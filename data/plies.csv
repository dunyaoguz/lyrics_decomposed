Why you trying to impress a bitch? The streets' opinion matter, that's why I'm on G shit My name is all I got, I'm willing to die for that shit I won't change for nothing, what you see is what you get A real nigga and a fuck nigga is something that don't mix I got my own cash, never been a ""yes man"" The few real niggas in the streets left, I'm your biggest fan  "

You hate us cause we us? Or you hate us cause we fought? Is it the way we live? Or is it the way we walk? We never had shit, so it can't be nothing we bought The shit yall took us through, probably the reason we off Our pride we still got it, the only thing we ain't lost Defending ourselves (shit) that was something we was taught Done been through the roughest times, but all of it ain't our fault Wish I can add up the years in prison our peoples caught The government, the strippers, we ain't really have a choice Your peoples go to college, mine peoples go to court Yo peoples was born with money, my peoples was born broke Yo peoples lived in mansions, my peoples hung from ropes Yo peoples had it made, all my peoples had was hope Yo peoples had help, all my peoples heard was NO My peoples thought about it, yo peoples cut our throats The respect we had for one another shit wasn't even close We had to entertain that was our only open door If we wanted to make it, we had to rap, sang, or try sports We couldn't afford a full ride, shit my people poor My people ain't mad, yo people hates us though But we the one who struggling, so why yall hate us for? The police want us bad The judge hate us more The jury think we guilty, before we come through the door And yall take our money, but yall won't help us though And yall biggest fear is to see my people grow But our biggest fear is too die before we turn 24 In every lawyers past, design to sank us more And every time we go to jail, yall get paid though But when we ask for money, yall slam the door They say our president black, but we can't tell though We only got ourselves, now that's what's real though I know yall hate our guts, that's how yall feel though But yall ain't gotta like us, just let us live though And cause we black bruh, don't mean we steal though And just cause we from the ghetto, don't be mean we dumb bro We just as smart as ya'll, but ya'll don't want the world to know But all we wanna know,why ya'll hate us so much? (why ya'll hate us so much?)(why ya'll hate us so much?) All we wanna know,why ya'll hate us so much? (why ya'll hate us so much?)(why ya'll hate us so much?) All we wanna know..."
