Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it? Thomas: Oh no, man.

Do you love me yet? No? Okay I'll go harder for you In fact, I rap till I collapse All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed About the ways to raise a child up To not become a product Of his environment, I need to cry and vent But I done built this wall up Actin' like everything's all good But in reality I'm lookin' for something Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after Nas, Cole, and Hov Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn' I'm used to being alone Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own? Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant Boosting my ego with every million that spills in And still then I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that? Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved By parents that was in too deep with the drugs Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit Be who you are, identify as a star No one tells you you're that It's something that you just know The world be stealing your glow Your mama did what she could Her life was miles from good Your father fell in the trap They set for you when you black They met when they was low And therefore you a product of that And so your trauma is deep Don't bury it you should weep And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em Just my opinion, only then can you find peace Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release I've been through it before Can only share with you what I know To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky But if you want to then you ought to know why Are you running from something With hopes of becoming someone That's finally worthy of love Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell Find God, learn to accept yourself And I'm gone, acceptance"

How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance? How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death? Derealization The sense of being out of one’s body I’m not here I’m not me I’m not real Nothing is Nothing but this feeling of panic Nobody understands Nobody knows the sufferings This physical feeling It can’t be anxiety It can’t Or can it? Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body? Yeah, of course I’m so in control of my mind and my body But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind I am unhappy Not with life But with this feeling I am scared, I am human, I am a man But I look in the mirror and I see a child I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit And they never did And it scares me Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me No, no this feeling This anxiety is nothing I have anxiety Just like you, the person I wrote this for And together we will overcome this feeling We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge That we are alive And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted We will rejoice in this gift that is life We will rejoice in this day that we have been given We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves Starting with mental health We will accept ourselves as we are And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror We will accept ourselves And live with anxiety"

Maturity Every single night, sacrifice rest to write Dusk 'till dawn, he be rappin' 'till the sun up Call him Super Mario he always get the one up Finally dropping tracks, now the mixtape is completed His appetite for perfection was seriously needed Then it dropped He would, sell it for twenty but his country in recession so Take it for ten homie consider it a blessing Yes he a rookie, but you know they respect him That Botox flow, so whenever he inject 'em Them haters tighten up their game but now it don't affect him 'Cause if they step out of line yeah you know he finna check 'em He grew up on the bottom, but dreamt about the top He finally found out that until he reach it he won't stop He's headed to the summit, where everybody plummet The game need change and Logic can break a hunnit The consul to the game so you know we run it Nah, that last line was, over dramatic But he coming for that ass and he gon' let 'em have it"

I mean we've seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it. I just can't imagine life anywhere but inside a space station. I mean the simple concept of a sky doesn't even fully register...   We do have fields on the Babel station and also—   Yeah, yeah—but that's all synthetic. I mean we're heading to this planet right? That we call ""Paradise"", because we hope it can sustain life. Why?""   Because we'll eventually run out of resources...   Exactly! I mean what if we got there and it's exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush—then we destroy it just like we did Earth? There's only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean, it's weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.   Man, what's your point?   The point is, 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this. Damn near all of them return home without any luck! Some of them didn't return at all.I guess my fear isn't that we won't find Paradise: it's that we'll create purgatory..."

I'm not sorry for making this album, and I made this album from a place in my heart of love... and I'm black and I'm proud as shit. That's the shit, that's the thing the whole world said I could never say or be or do. And I'm biracial and I love my fans. Swag. Flex. Rattpack   C'mon! Is it going? Alright, what's up guys, This is day one of recording for the, I mean *Claps* Hey, What's up guys. Make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because we're real all the time. RattPack My studio is being built    [Logic, Bobby Campbell, and 6ix In The Studio] Logic: *Tapping on glass* Bobby Campbell: *Tapping his foot* ""What are you going to contribute?"" 6ix: *Claps*   That was the first song ever created in this room   Yeah, That's the first beat ever, damn (To 6ix): But like, what's it like from, going to what's going to be in here from Charles Hall?   Oh, Nuts. It's gon- It's the come up. It's the glow up. It's what we've always wanted   Uh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 o'clock. When white people find out that I'm black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and I've heard this, ""Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesn't matter."" Shit like that, that I've heard. It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story You know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived  [Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People] There's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the ""first man"" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like ""Life, What's it all about?"" And he's like ""What? What the fuck you talkin' about?"" He's like ""Where am I?"" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy   I can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time   Logic: So what now, what advice can you give me? Neil: What advice can I give humanity?  [Logic And Friends In The Studio] You guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL   Oh Yeah   So he plays this guy named Atom   Big Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit   This guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one   Hip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination   I was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called ""The Egg."" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought ""wow,"" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that   So bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score   I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did     This is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see   So yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like ""I'm fine, I'm fine"" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected   Fan: Logic? Logic: 'Sup dude? Fan: What's going on man, how's you day? Logic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man? Fan: Raymond Logic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond Raymond: You have a great day Logic: Thanks brother   Yeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks   It's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like ""you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up."" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety   When I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time   I think that's good, ah!   The first time in my life I have done anything like that   You never?   I'm not really sure how it goes   Now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it  [Logic and Lucy In The Booth]     Yo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys   Hold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...    It's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same    Alright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit  I think this is harder than when I did ""Gang Related.""    Let me hear that... Woo!   So I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing.  You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good   I lost my job to Bart Simpson?   Yeah, you're fucking out bro  (Driving) I was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool   We shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0   Just out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it   My thoughts were just by far his best work, for me   And I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah   I mean, I can- I can rap   No I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of   I haven't really recorded a song in 20 years   I texted J. Cole and I was like, ""Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.,"" and he was like ""WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that?"" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. ""Only you could get him to do that""  I've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon   The concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored   America, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads    When I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the ""ohhhh "" and it goes off  You'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it     When Logic approached me with the contributing to the song ""America"" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song   We worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him ""hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.""   The first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration   What's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit   Big Von, he just gets really entertaining     Got Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories   So I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre   So, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say ""Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?"" And he's like ""I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.""   Everybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like ""Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy."" But then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like ""I'm gonna go look for something else"", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this  This is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine   I'm like ""Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?"" and he's like ""Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.""  Early into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but there's limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?  I went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover   This is going to be my album cover   The album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly   For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against  I didn't wanna be like ""I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do  I am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover   Thank you! This is dope, so dope   I appreciate it, Thank you     I see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like ""Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?""  So I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula   Hiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel   We were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it   I was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun   I was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun  But like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit   I told him to come on the stage and said ""Show me what you got."" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was   After dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said ""yeah.""    [Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]   Kev, I love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound     I just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, ""Anziety"" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening  [1-800-273-8255 producing]     We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here  (to the orchestra) I just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality   Yo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy   Yeah, we're just like Neanderthals  (Laughing)   Like all the sheet music, but like what we sample     My name is Bobby ""Smokey"" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him     It's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)   Bobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived  I took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said ""That boy got bars.""   You were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like ""We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic."" And I was like... excuse me? You were like ""You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?"" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant   So when did that click for you what that meant?   Oh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like ""What does that mean when you fuck with someone?"" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something  (Laughing)   This is a classic documentary moment right here   Lucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?   So yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, ""I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys"" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?  (Laughing)  She said that just means like a lame person  Well, I fuck with Logic   Yeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose   I fuck with you all   We fuck with you  (Laughing)   It was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in And I'm like ""Dillon what's that?"" And he's like ""its that P1 bro, for sure.""  And I'm like ""damn that's crazy, thats so cool"", he's like ""yeah man check it out"", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this  So i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for ""Like Woah"", and it's worth every penny  [Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]   This is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like "" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night"" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions  It's called ""Ink Blot"" because one of the line is ""I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be."" And he's rapping like ""yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.""  Like that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, ""yeah yeah I rap"", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song [Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot] Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob That’s crazy! Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, ""Aw fuck""   So, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)   Did you smoke a Jefferey?   Freefalllll   Woah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go  (All hands on deck)  Keep going   You're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging   Oh, sorry   Hello, sir, how are you doing today?   I'm doing good, how are you doing?   You brought the whole--   Yeah, we brought the whole team   Oh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?   I'm upset that I did what I'm supposed to do. That's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I've failed before, many times. It's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it   We're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things   Thank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag  Got that license though     ""Black Spiderman"" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not     Like, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is ""Peace, Love and Positivity"", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, ""I'm a rapper"", and they go ""What?"" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. ""Oh, you speak white"" or ""you talk white"", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean ""talk white""? What the fuck does that mean?  I said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with ""Black Jesus, Black Jesus"". And people are like ""What? Black Jesus? What the fuck?"" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house   I've known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like ""I think I need some vocals on here"". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping   And like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was   He was like ""this is 6 years in the making that just came out"". And...   I don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose     Something about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally   YES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!   You just earned yourself a feature credit   It was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up   I only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture   With Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project     When i first met [?] I could see this [?]     I mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world   Mannnn, come on. Thanks man   Logic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me "" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand"". ""Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music."" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something   It's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life  It makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it Ooooo I just gave you some fire!  With my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like ""Yeah what's up!"" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks  And I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something  So fuck everybody else  "

Just being rich? Yeah, yeah   Uh Visions of seeing myself as someone different Reality got me feeling indifferent I'm lifting this weight off my shoulder But hold up, older I get I reload the clip and sip on something I feel good for nothing All my glory days behind me or beyond me I’m folding like origami My tables turning like interior decorators Levels like elevators These haters got me questioning my judgement Tried by a jury of my peers, but where the judge went? What will my legacy be? Who will my enemy be? In due time as I write this rhyme I don't know Flash before my eyes Yeah, uh   And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray? And reminisce of another day, uh I came from nothing, a child born in poverty Went to college to gain knowledge So they would acknowledge me Honestly, I got a good job I found a woman, made her my wife But spent more time at work So we could have a stable life And when my son was born I had to work even harder Before I knew it, now my wife was giving birth to my daughter Went from 40 hours a week to 80 Ain't nobody gon’ pay me but myself Sacrifice my time and my health, for wealth I missed a birthday, miss an anniversary There's lots of people in this world that's worse than me I wasn't there for my son's first words But he ain't grow up in the hood like me, we in the burbs Sacrifice a couple years, he could have all the money when I'm gone What a fool I was I missed his graduation, I missed her wedding day I didn't even get to give my little girl away But I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon I’m not there right now but I will be later I’m working on something that's greater That’s my legacy Uh, I'm gon' be remembered by generations to come Damn, you dumb You won't be remembered by your son Uh, yeah   To be remembered by generations to come You a fool You won’t be remembered by your son ""Nonsense, nonsense!"" I said to the man with no money, nonsense, uh, uh Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity I look in the mi-look in the mi-the mirror, I ain't clearer I'm just trying to be free— who is that? It surely ain't me As I lay on my deathbed, I realized I was wrong I have been the richest man in the world all along A beautiful family that all I did was ignore For financial stability and fear of being poor 'Cause when I was a child, knew I always wanted more When I was a child, knew I always wanted more, more, more And now I got it, uh And now I'm laying in this bed; cancer spreading through my lungs Looking at my family like ""Damn, y'all were the ones"" I sacrificed my life for 100's, 50's, 20's, 10's, 5's, and 1's So dumb, I'd give it all if I could Do it for my heart again, not my wallet I hate to recall it but it's gone now—legacy is gone now Sacrifice my health for wealth, no, it wasn't worth it But as I take my last breath, I know that I deserved it   Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy The legacy you gon' leave behind you forever is the blood in your veins Wake up, Daddy, now is the time for change And as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change, Daddy Just as long as we livin' Just as long as we livin', Daddy I just want to be happy, I don't give a damn if we live in a shoebox Now my mama gon' tell you what you got   I love you, I love you, I love you, I want you, I need you, I crave you Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you? Why you fucking 'round behind my back While I'm home raising my children? Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it Supposed to be husband and wife, you more like my opponent Finger fucking myself 'cause fuck infidelity I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib Can I live? Can I have a life away from my life? Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife? You know I love 'em—but if that test wasn't positive I woulda had a lot to give Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half Motherfucker But I stay 'cause I love these children And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but You never there 'Cause you just want to be the best You just want to make this money, uh Come get this pussy, motherfucker Come get this pussy and love your children Fuck your legacy Fuck it   Float in the abyss of nothingness My consciousness remembers a life before it hits black I wish that I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream And there's only like four of us on the tour bus And I'm in the back, how 'bout that? Thinkin' 'bout my legacy And how we as human beings sacrifice health for money Ain't it funny? 'Cause in the end, we spend all our money on repairing our body and mind When we really should have just spent time Fuck a legacy I'ma go live my life Peace"

We’d like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can’t earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uh—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...  You’ll be doing things you don’t like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn’t matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...  But, it’s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don’t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we’re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up ""their"" children, to do the same thing. So, it’s all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it’s so important to consider this question...  ""What do I desire?""
