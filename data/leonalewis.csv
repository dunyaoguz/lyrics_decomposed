Boy, there's no excuse Cause of what you did There's no me and you   Would you like it if I Did the same thing You would not like Walking in time? Boy, there's no excuse That's who you are And I'm so over you   You let me down, can't fix you now Thought I could count on you to be around You bring me down, down, down, way down You let me down, thought I had found Someone to catch me when I hit the ground You bring me down, down, down, way down   Down Down Stop bringing me Stop bringing me Down Down"
