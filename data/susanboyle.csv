Will the circle be unbroken By and by, by and by? Is a better home awaiting In the sky, in the sky?  In the joyous days of childhood Oft' they told of wondrous love Pointed to the dying saviour Now they dwell with him above  Will the circle be unbroken By and by, by and by? Is a better home awaiting In the sky, in the sky?  You remember songs of heaven Which you sang with childish voice Do you love the hymns they taught you Or are songs of earth your choice?  You can picture happy gath'rings Round the fireside long ago And you think of tearful partings When they left you here below  Will the circle be unbroken By and by, by and by? Is a better home awaiting In the sky, in the sky?  One by one their seats were emptied One by one they went away Now the family is parted Will it be complete one day?  Will the circle be unbroken By and by, by and by? Is a better home awaiting In the sky, in the sky?"

A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for the cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in a war For a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found? The same old fears Wish you were here  How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl Year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found? The same old fears Wish you were here Wish you were here  So, so you think you can tell"

What in my ignorant prayers Am i failing to say? Never before have i questioned the truth of your being Never once have i dared Never until today  All of a tremble I stand on the edge of confusion Who is to save me If into the darkness i fall? Now that i need more than ever my god to be near me Do you hear when i call? Are you there after all?  You have to be there, you have to My life i have placed in thy keep And without you i am drifting on a dark and stormy sea You have to be there, you have to Without you i'd drown in the deep Too far, too far from land The waters drag me down I reach for your hand  And when i die will throw open his arms to receive me? Who will forgive me and take me and show me his face? When i go to my rest, who will watch me and wake me? When my time comes at last, will you grant me your grace? I am so small of this earth, i am nothing without you Daring to doubt you at all turns a knife in my heart Little by little i'm losing my way in the shadows I am losing my hope and the world falls apart  You do have to be there, you have to My life i have placed in thy keep And without you i am drifting on a dark and stormy sea You have to be there, you have to Without you i'd drown in the deep Too far, too far from land The waters drag me down I reach for your hand  You have to be there, you have to Too far, too far from land The waters drag me down I reach for your hand"
