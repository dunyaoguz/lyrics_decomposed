Hard for me to understand So I wrote him this song (wrote him this song) When I look him in his eyes Knew I couldn't change his mind So I wrote this melody And I'm saying sweet goodbye   I tried to give him hope And promised him my life But I don't know What made him want to leave this life And as he went away A tear fell from my eye And there's no turning back There's only goodbye   I love my baby so (oh, baby) But he's not here no more Hard for me to understand So I wrote him this song (I wrote you this song) When I look him in his eyes Knew I couldn't change his mind (oh, he cried) So I wrote this melody And I'm saying sweet goodbye (I need you) I love my baby so But he's not here no more (he's not here) Hard for me to understand So I wrote him this song (I wrote this song) When I look him in his eyes Knew I couldn't change his mind So I wrote this melody And I'm saying sweet goodbye   I love you so (I love you) I need you so It's hard to imagine my life here without you (I love you) I love you so (It hurts so bad) I need you so It's hard to imagine my life here without you"

We made it official, baby Oh With me and you  Every night I close my eyes I thank the Lord that you're laying next to me I didn't think it was possible But loving you brings out the best in me, baby  I'll always take the time to love you right Hold you tight Keep you coming home every night For you  Ain't nobody gonna change my mind Don't think twice I've been waiting all my life for you, baby  Got me wondering How did you survive all this time Without you? Without you, you, you Without you (I'll do anything, anything, anything, anything)"
