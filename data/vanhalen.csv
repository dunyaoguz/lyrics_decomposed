Stay Frosty Stay Frosty now, alright  I travelled to the South The ancient Rabbi appeared to me Voice heavy with the sands of time, he made me see ""Same as Kabalah Dave but for you it's free God guides us on our journey But careful with those feet""  Stay frosty In a world without end Stay Frosty Like the ancient immortals said Don't want 'em to get your goat Don't show 'em where it's hid But that's just what I did Stay Frosty! Look out Stay Frosty!  I journeyed to the East And I struggled to stay afloat A solitary Buddhist Monk threw me a rope Looked me in the eye And said, ""Don't make me say this twice You want to be a monk, you got to cook a lot of rice""  Stay Frosty In a world without end Stay Frosty Work hard at this my friends Look beyond the Kung Fu fighting God is love But get it in writing Stay Frosty Stay Frosty now  I wandered out West To the California Coast Where the folks who know about frostiness stay frostiest the most My brand new landlord proposed me a toast ""My West Coast host""  Stay Frosty Chant it like a Mantra Stay Frosty And there's nothing you can't handle Far and wide far as you ramble Trust in Allah But tie up your camel, and remember... Stay Frosty!"

With more time to kill Hey! I barely survived Yeah, I barely survived   Like pouring salt on an open wound Memory filling, filling this empty room I'm as bare, I'm as bare, as a barren womb Still like the air, in a whitewash tomb Ahhhhh...     A year to the day! Year to the day! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! A year to the day! Three sixty-five! Three sixty-five, five, fiiive! Ahhhhh..."
