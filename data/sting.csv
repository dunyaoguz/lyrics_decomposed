When there's a higher philosophy in reflection and defeat  50,000 voices rising every time he'd sing And every word he ever wrote reflecting back to him Still believing that old lie, the one that your own face betrays Rock Stars don't ever die, they only fade away  Reflecting now on my own past Inside this prison I've made of myself I'm feeling a little better today Although the bathroom mirror is telling me something else  These lines of stress, one bloodshot eye The unhealthy pallor of a troubled ghost Where did I put my spectacle case? I'm half blind and as deaf as any post  50,000 hands are raised to a man that's just like you and me We create the gods we can and gift them immortality Still believing that old lie, the one that your own face betrays Rock Stars don't ever die, they only fade away"

How can I tell? Which side of the bed she takes when the day begins She can be kind She can be cruel She's got me guessing like a game show fool   She can change her mind like she changes her sweaters From one minute to the next it's hard to tell She blows hot and cold just like stormy weather She's my gift from the Lord or a fiend from hell That's my baby She can be all four seasons in one day   Watching the weatherman's been no good at all Winter, spring, summer, I'm bound for a fall There are no long term predictions for my baby She can be all four seasons in one day   If it's a sunny day I take my umbrella Just in case the raindrops start to fall You could say that I'm just a cautious fellow I don't want to be caught in a sudden squall That's my baby She can be all four seasons in one day That's my baby She can be all four seasons in one day"

All this time the river flowed Endlessly like a silent tear All this time the river flowed Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?   Teachers told the Romans built this place They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town They lived and they died They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left Were the stones the workmen found   All this time the river flowed In the falling light of a Northern sun If I had my way, take a boat from the river Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one One by one"

/songs/389571,Sting,And Yet,https://genius.com/Sting-and-yet-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/389571,The Last Ship,2013-08-13," This town, this stain on the sunrise Disguised in the mist this morning It's 8 a.m., a seagull shouts a sailor's warning This sky, this bend in the river Slows down and delivers me, the tide rolls back And all my memories fade to black   And yet, and yet, I'm back   This town has a strange magnetic pull Like a homing signal in your skull And you sail by the stars of the hemisphere Wondering how in the Hell did ye end up here? It's like an underground river, or a hidden stream That flows through your head, and haunts your dreams And you stuffed those dreams in this canvas sack And there's nothing round here that the wide world lacks   And yet, and yet, you're back   Some nights I'd lie on the deck and I'd stare at the turning of the stars Those constellations hanging up there from the cables and the rigging I'd wonder if she saw the same, or managed to recall my name But why would she ever think of me? Some boy she loved who fled to sea? And why waste time debating whether she'd be waiting for the likes of me? So you drift into port with the scum of the seas To the dance halls and the brothels where you took your ease! And the ship's left the dock but you're half past caring And you haven't got a clue whose bed you're sharing And your head's like a hammer on a bulkhead door And it feels like somebody might have broken your jaw And there's bloodstains and glass all over the floor And you swear to God you'll drink no more And yet, and yet In truth, it's too late to find her Too late to remind her at some garden gate Where a servant tells me I should wait And perhaps a door's slammed in my face My head must be in outer space   And yet, and yet Before the sun has set Before the sea There may be something else that's waiting for The likes of me   This town, this stain on the sunrise"

Have you ever had the feeling That you're that close to losing your mind? You look around each corner Hoping that she's there You try to play it cool, perhaps Pretend that you don't care But it doesn't do a bit of good You got to seek 'til you find Or you'll never unwind Try to think that loves not around Still it's uncomfortably near My old heart, ain't gaining no ground Because my angel eyes ain't here Angel eyes that old devil sent They glow unbearably bright Need I say, that my loves misspent? Misspent with angel eyes tonight So drink up all you people Order anything you see Have fun you happy people The drink, and the laughs on me Pardon me, but I've got to run The facts uncomfortably clear Got to find who's now number one And why my angel eyes ain't here Tell me why my angel eyes ain't here Asking why my angel eyes ain't here Excuse me, while I disappear"

If thou can't not overcome her will Thy love will be thus fruitless ever   Was I so base, that I might not aspire Unto those high joys which she holds from me? As they are high, so high is my desire If this she deny, what can granted be? If she will yield to that which reason is It is reason's will that love should be just Dear, make me happy still by granting this Or cut off delays if that I die must   Better a thousand times to die Than for to live thus still tormented Dear, but remember it was I Who for thy sake did die contented"

For a sailor's not a man to be trusted He's treacherous as tides and hidden reefs And just to get you up the stairs He'll quote the Bible in his prayers And before you know he's bound for Tenerife And when the tide rolls out You'll find your house is empty and he's gone And when the tide rolls out You'll find your heart is empty and he's gone And when you become a woman of a certain age You'll find it's difficult to trust a man Difficult to gauge, when that bills rat who left you Without a living wage thinks there's still That tawdry glamour of the sea That, I swear to God's completely lost on me So, if you ever hear me talking to a sailor Some mangy sea-dog skulking on the quay Ah, just remind me what I've said Or you can shoot me in the head And then throw my bleeding body in the sea! You'll find your bed is empty and he's--gone!"

The ghost of his father long dead all these years? Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears? Or the terrible sum of all of his fears In the eyes of this stranger who meets him? So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline To face up to the truth of his soul It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge Something strange, unexpected, out of control There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection And face what he sees without fear It takes a man to accept his mortality Or be surprised by the presence of a tear It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else   Like a covering of snow on a winter's night It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts You still love her but she loves someone else   And where does that leave you? You self-styled man of vision You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind? To destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission? Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind? To regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man Use the ice around your heart before it melts But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself   Like a covering of snow on a winter's night It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts And still you still love her but she loves someone else"

That they all exist in parallel Each one separate from the other And every subsequent decision Makes a new world then another And they all stretch out towards infinity Getting further and further away Now, were a man to reconsider his position And try to spin the world back to its original state? It's not a scientific proposition And relatively speaking, you're late It's not the same moon in the sky And these are different stars And these are different constellations From the ones that you've described Different rules of navigation Strange coordinates and lines A completely different zodiac Of unfamiliar signs It's not the same moon in the sky And those planets are misleading I wouldn't even try to take a bearing or a reading Just accept that things are different You've no choice but to comply When smarter men have failed to see The logic as to why   It's not the same moon It's not the same moon In the sky"

It's getting close to midnight baby And we ain't got time to spare  Just when I think I'm home and dry And she's given up the fight There's an unmistakable optimism In romantic music and candlelight There's this lingering perfume The merest ghost of the past She says wait a minute baby You're moving way too fast We'd better check the weather chart Before we raise this mast We'd best consult our horoscope In case this feeling wasn't meant to last Let's just forget about the future And get on with the past

Stars keep secrets as they wander in-discretely  And the echoes of a song go drifting by  We must be careful not to lose our way completely  Or the magic that we see (seek?) here  We can't be sure will be here  In the morning  With the moon away  And if in each other's arms  Is where we're meant to stay  In the love-light  When our eyes have grown accustomed to the daylight  We'll see what waits for us to share  For all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight  Will be there

E se il mio regno diventa sabbia E cade in fondo al mare: Io muoio per te Io muoio per te!  E dalle fonde oscure valli Canzoni antiche di tristezza Ma ogni passo io pensavo a te Ogni passo solo a te Per ogni stella un granello di sabbia Gli avanzi di un asciutto mare Dimmi quanto tempo, quanto ancora!  C'è una città nel deserto e riposa La vanità di un antico re Ma la città riposa in pezzi Dove il vento urla all'avvoltoio Quello che ha fatto l'uomo Con l'ambizione è tutto questo  Io farò prigione la mia vita Se sei la sposa per un altro  Che i miei nemici siano liberi Io cado e sono qui Che muoio per te Io muoio per te!  E solo come mai Così solo come ora mai! Con tutti i miei domani Cosa sono qui Sono niente così Non ci sono vittorie Nelle nostre storie, senza amor!  A un passo da Gerusalemme E a solo un miglio dalla luna Sotto un cielo di milioni di stelle Ho il cuore perso in un pianeta lontano Che gira intorno e cade giù Con archi di tristezza  Io muoio per te Io muoio per te!  E anche se hai le chiavi E distruggi quel che ho Ogni prigione in polvere Nemici più non ho I regni miei di sabbia Che vanno in fondo al mare  Io muoio per te Io muoio per te!"

She watches the pretty young soldiers As they march themselves off to the war She wonders if she'll ever see him again Somehow she doubts it, but she has to be sure  So she rode into town on the very next day And dressed herself up all in man's array With a sword and a musket she took the King's shilling And to fight in some foreign war She said, ""Yes!,"" she'd be willing  All you pretty young soldiers In those uniforms that you've never worn The Captain will come to inspect you all now ""Let me down and you'll all wish you'd never been born.""  The Captain astride of his horse's grey flanks Pulls the pretty young soldier from out of the ranks His gaze it is fixed and she's starting to shake He said, ""Follow me soldier and listen to the offer that I'm willing to make.""  ""Come you pretty young soldier Come and be my right hand You're having this strange effect on my soul That I don't quite understand.""  ""Captain, oh Captain, I've a confession to make I love someone else and my heart it will break."" And as she released her brown hair from a band It tumbled all down her shoulders and into his hands  ""Oh you pretty young soldier Come and take my right hand You're having this strange effect on my soul And now I think, I understand."""

Why, they’d tell him that they had to get a ship built   We build battleships and cruisers (ah) For her Majesty the Queen Super tankers for Onassis, (ah) And all the classes in between We built the greatest shipping tonnage That the world has ever seen   And the only life we’ve known is in the shipyard  Now, gentlemen   Steel in the stockyard Iron in the soul We’ll conjure up a ship Where there used to be a hole  But we don’t know what we’ll do If the yard gets sold   For the only life we’ve known is in the shipyard   Why are we makin’ nice with this bloke if he’s just out to shut us down?

I'm too afraid to care, I'm too afraid to know I'm too afraid to look behind me At the feast of the crow   We spoke our fears to the captain And asked what his son could know For we would never have marched so far To be food for a crow Something the boy said"
/songs/389602,Sting,So To Speak,https://genius.com/Sting-so-to-speak-lyrics,http://api.genius.com/songs/389602,The Last Ship,2013-09-20," They're seriously saying it's prolonging me life If I'll only submit to the surgical knife? But what are the odds on a month or a week? When the betting shop's closing its doors, so to speak When you're tied to a pump and a breathing machine With their X-rays and probes and their monitor screens And they'll wake you up hungry, saying ""How do you feel?"" And then you're stuffed full of pills and a barium meal Prolonging me life? Now that's some kind of joke I'd be laughing me head off and I'd probably choke The spirit's still willing but the rest of me's weak Now the bets are all off and the prospects look bleak When you're laid like a piece of old meat on the slab And they'll cut and they'll slice, and they'll poke and they'll jab And they'll grill ye and burn ye, and they'll wish ye good health With their radium, chemo and God knows what else? Well you can't fault the science, though the logic is weak Is it really an eternal life we should seek? That ship has sailed That ship has already sailed, so to speak   Our mission is more than a struggle for breath For a few extra rounds in a fight to the death When our mission is love, and compassion and grace It's not a test of endurance, or a marathon race For love is the sabre, and love is the shield Love is the only true power we wield An eternal love is all you should seek   I hear what you're saying because I've heard it before But I'm afraid if I let what is past through my door How long would he stay, a month or a week When that ship has already sailed, so to speak? Should I settle for something that's safe on this Earth? What would it profit me, what is it worth? If I lose something precious, completely unique? When it's only eternity's love we should seek For when that ship sails, and the course has been set And the wind's in the offing and the sails have been let And the hatches are full, and the hull doesn't leak   I'm tired and fading and losing the light And I've no way to tell if it's day or it's night Follow your heart, it's the harbour you seek And this ship is ready to sail"

All the porters debate ""Why they're going to Newcastle and they dare not be late For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide And they've come from all over, from far and from wide"" There's the old Dalai Lama, aye and the Pontiff of Rome Every palace in Europe, and there's nay bugger home There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails ""Why, they haven't got tickets,"" ""Come now, it's just a detail There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail!"" When the last ship sails   Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails   And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done And whatever the station in life you've become In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun When the last ship sails   Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails"

Where is the keeper in his carrion coat? Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies Where is the child with his father's eyes?  There are the soul cages   He's the king of the ninth world The twisted son of the fog bells toll In each and every lobster cage A tortured human soul  These are the souls of broken factories The subject slaves of the broken crown The dead accounting of old guilty promises These are the souls of the broken town   These are the soul cages 'I have a wager' the brave child spoke The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke 'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me And if the drink leaves me standing, a soul shall go free' 'I have here a cask of most magical wine A vintage that blessed every ship in the line It's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died Young white bodies adrift in the tide' 'And what's in it for me, my pretty young thing? Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings? If you lose a wager with the king of the sea You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me  A body lies open in the fisherman's yard Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips One less soul in the soul cages One last curse on the fisherman's lips   Swim to the light Swim to the light  And he dreamed of the ship on the sea It would carry his father and he To a place they could never be found To a place far away from this town A Newcastle ship without coals They would sail to the island of souls"

Held fast to the wheel of the rocking ship As I squinted my eyes in the rain  For the ship had turned into the wind Against the storm to brace And underneath the sailor's hat I saw my father's face  If a prayer today is spoken Please offer it for me When the bridge to heaven is broken And you're lost on the wild wild sea And you're lost on the wild wild sea

This cowboy song is all I know To bring me back into your arms Your distant sun, your shining light You'll be my dog-star shining tonight   I've been the lowest of the low on the planet I've been a sinner all my days When I was living with my hand on the trigger I had no sense to change my ways The preacher asked if I'd embrace the resurrection To suck the poison from my life Just like an existential cowboy villain His words were balanced on my knife     Every night All my distances afar   Dog-star"

Aye, and what have we got, but the laying of a keel? And what have we got, but the cranes above us soaring? The commotion and the clamor in the welding of the steel?

Where we work in horizontal rain, and shiver in the cold   What do you got? (What do we got?) You've got nowt. We've got nowt else   What have you got, but the singing in the cables? Oh, what have you got, but the ringing in your ears? Aye, what have you got, but the telling of the fables? And the memories of the ships, that we've been building donkey's years   What do you got? (What do we got?) You've got nowt. We've got nowt else   Aye, you've got to die of something It's written in your fate You may as well die of a Tuesday And woe betide you're late   What have you got, all you men what's fit and able? What have you got, for the straining in your neck? What have you got, when you're laid out on the table? And the snapping of a cable when the rigging hits the deck? What have you got, but the loyalty of brothers? What have you got, but this union of the dock? What have you got, a bacon sandwich from your mother? Not a promise of another with the punching of the clock   What do you got? (What do we got?) You've got nowt. We've got nowt else"
