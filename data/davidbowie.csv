Who praised Their efforts To be free? Words of strength and care And sympathy I opened doors That would have blocked Their way I braved Their cause to guide For little pay I ravaged at my finance just for Those Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility Those who said a new world, new ways ever free Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me   I bless you madly Sadly as I tie my shoes I love you badly Just in time, at times, I guess Because of you I need to rest Because it's you That sets the test   So much has gone And little is new And as the sunrise stream Flickers on me My friends talk Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word ""We had a friend, a talking man Who spoke of many powers that he had Not of the best of men, but Ours We used him We let him use his powers We let him fill Our needs Now We are strong And the road is coming to its end Now the damned have no time to make amends No purse of token fortune stands in Our way The silent guns of love Will blast the sky We broke the ruptured structure built of age Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage Where money stood We planted seeds of rebirth And stabbed the backs of fathers Sons of dirt Infiltrated business cesspools Hating through Our sleeves Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat Stoned the poor On slogans such as Wish You Could Hear Love Is All We Need Kick Out The Jams Kick Out Your Mother Cut Up Your Friend Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above And We Can Force You to Be Free And We Can Force You to Believe"" And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain It said: ""I believe in the Power of Good I Believe in the State of Love I Will Fight For the Right to be Right I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"" And I open my eyes to look around And I see a child laid slain On the ground As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command But not hearing anymore Not hearing anymore Just the shrieks from the old rich And I Want to Believe In the madness that calls 'Now' And I want to Believe That a light's shining through Somehow   And I Want to Believe And You Want to Believe And We Want to Believe And We Want to Live Oh, We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live   I bless you madly Sadly as I tie my shoes I love you badly Just in time, at times, I guess Because of you I need to rest Because it's you That sets the test Live Live Live"

Hey hey He was never quite unsure but really sane Wants to play  Jackson stole twenty souls in a day To take away A take away He takes away And no complaints Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade Wood Jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way Hey hey Just wants to play And how he played The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life Heaven knows he's really torn it now The words that killed Wood Jackson's friends were written on the wall Heaven knows he's for it  Shame! Just wants to play It's a shame Shame It's a shame Wants to play It's a shame It's a shame Just wants to play"
