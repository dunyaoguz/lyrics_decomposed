Why not try? This constant game I play to stay high But all is just a state of mind All is reality of your choice Constant evolution, constant adaptation Constant state of moving nowhere  Footsteps, silence is loud Kindness is brave, wisdom is long Loving is necessary, I need it, we need it Searching, looking for the satisfaction It is nowhere, it is everywhere  Preaching, pleading, praying for God to come What are we waiting for? Why are we so afraid of taking charge? But it's always changing, always In the constant state of going nowhere  We all have demons to battle, roads to walk Crosses to bear, mistakes and sins Candles and their steady glow Water and its constant crash  Endless horizon, rocks of times long gone Still strong, still here and so are we Here we are forever The constant state of going nowhere  The constant state of going nowhere Constant state of going nowhere Con-con-constant state of moving nowhere Constant state of moving nowhere  It's like a jungle It's like a jungle  It's like a jungle out here, so much struggle out here And my dreams steal my rest, sleep's the cousin of death Always feels like a race against father time In the streets of New York  All I see is street hoes, and bullet holes in my people Only crime fills the brain, feels like I'm going insane The revolution has to start, don't waste no time In the streets of New York  New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City New York, New York, New York, New York, New York City  Livin' in the city Livin' in the city New York, New York City Livin' in the city  Livin' in the city Livin' in the city New York, New York City Livin' in the city  Livin' in the city Livin' in the city New York, New York City Livin' in the city Livin' in the city"
