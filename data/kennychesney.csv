Always gonna be you that I love   Where does a man seek his salvation? When does his mind finally go free? Is the pain he feels the only explanation For believing lies are true For the stone inside his shoe The endless ways the years keep haunting me   I could find an empty church Get down on my knees Tell myself the mercy Is a matter of degrees Then lay down in some angel's arms Convinced I've found the one I'm dreaming' of But it's always gonna be you Always gonna be you that I love   Always gonna be you, that I love That I love"
