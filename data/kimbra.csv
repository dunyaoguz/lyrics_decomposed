Misery in the comedown, when I come down from here Are we tangled in each other or placed in between? Like a stone or a stones throw away from falling Am I just sketch in the landscape Or arranged close to you? I think I fell into a strange fate with Wandering Limbs And Eager Hands   Now the sun's gone to lay, I can lust towards space I'll transcend into blues, fade out from the ground greys I feel so beautiful, kept me out from the crowd cries I got the birds eye view, now we're all just dots in a sky   Am I caught in the background, or part of the scene? Misery in the comedown, when I come down from here Are we tangled in each other or placed in between? Like a stone or a stones throw away from falling Am I just sketch in the landscape Or arranged close to you? I think I fell think I fell into a strange fate with Wandering Limbs And Eager Hands   Eager Hands Eager Hands Eager Hands Eager Hands (Ah Ah Ah Ah...)"

Ooh, if you're so sure it's rational Well, the world's shrinking But that don't make it logical What am I thinking? If you say I'm just an animal I feel like I'm sinking You can't explain away the way I feel   You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down They tell you, ""Trust your head, be like men,"" but never feel like you're good enough You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love   Cry for the ones you love I'll be your warrior, your warrior (Cry for the ones you love) I'll be your warrior, your warrior (Warrior)   You're taking over and I'm feeling small When I was a child I knew it all Nothing magical, no hologram behind the door Just a chain reaction, but I know I'm made for more   What am I thinking? Ooh, if you're so sure it's rational Well, the world's shrinking But that don't make it logical What am I thinking? If you say I'm just an animal I feel like I'm sinking You can't explain away the way I feel   You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down They tell you, ""Trust your head, be like men,"" but never feel like you're good enough You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love And you're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down You wanna change the world, but your girls will be seen and not be heard You just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down They wanna take our light, make us fight, and never cry for the ones you love     You're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down They tell you, ""Trust your head, be like men,"" but never feel like you're good enough You're just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down They wanna take our light, make us fight, and then cry for the ones you love And you're just pushing me down, pushing me down, pushing me down You wanna change the world, but your girls will be seen and not be heard You just crushing me down, crushing me down, crushing me down They wanna take our light, make us fight, and never cry for the ones you love"

No, I can't withdraw your heart from mine You're the one thing that sticks, right onto my side I can't withdraw your heart from mine"

(Music Inspired by the Motion Picture),None,"Making my amends A resurrection The needle and the thread I'll start with my hands  This is your salvation Your reincarnation I hear them snickering when they smile This be my clockwork  With my hands With my hands  Making my amends Your broken pieces Create the prototype And bring you back to life  I wanna see you dance And take my second chance Don't care what they heard Just be my clockwork  With my hands With my hands  I can put you back together With my own hands This time I'll make you better, better, better I'll make the people gather To see what I've made I'll raise you from the dead Cause I don't wanna be alone again  Wake up (With my hands) Wake up (With my hands) Wake up (With my hands) Wake up  I need a sign of life To see a spark inside Create the chemistry To bring you back to me  It's a love electrical Almost mechanical Let them all run scared Just be my best friend  I'll put you back together With my own hands This time I'll make you better, better, better I'll make the people gather To see what I've made I'll raise you from the dead Cause I don't wanna be alone again  It's now or never You're gonna wake up, change my fate again Wake up This time will be forever and ever and ever  Such a frail tether Fight the clock hands I'll raise you from the grave Cause I don't wanna be alone again  Wake up  I can put you back together With my own hands This time I'll make you better, better, better I'll make the people gather To see what I've made I'll raise you from the dead Cause I don't wanna be alone again  You're gonna wake up  Forever and ever and ever  Wake up  I'll raise you from the dead Cause I don't wanna be alone again  A part of me, a part of you A part of you  A part of me, a part of you A part of you  A part of me, a part of you A part of you  A part of me, a part of you"
