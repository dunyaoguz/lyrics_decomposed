The pain is physical My lungs collapse I couldn't breathe I couldn't let it go The lump inside my throat, that couldn't stop me from screaming aloud My head was spinning and my body was pinned to the ground I can't believe it's over I feel so, I feel so And there's times when, the way she makes me feel something I never felt before She makes me feel like I'm just ill  I feel so empty I'm so scared I need her back I want the world to know I couldn't let her go, so I, I held a cab I took a plane, I hopped a train I had to let her know, it's been so difficult Now that I found her I'm spinning around The sky is moving but my body is pinned to the ground, back on that rollercoaster"
