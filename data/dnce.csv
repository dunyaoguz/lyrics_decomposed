If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom! Just pick a spot on the map And I'll get you there and back If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom!   Pedal to... Pedal like the devil, gonna drive you straight to heaven 'Til you're smiling hard Wishin' on a bottle, that your engine's 'bout to throttle Like a shootin' star, yeah   I got a full tank, lady, and I'm ready to drive I got a full tank, baby, just look up at the sky Name the time and place and I'll come get you It don't matter if it's near or far, no, woah   Woah hey You say that you hate it here So why don't we disappear? If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom! Just pick a spot on the map And I'll get you there and back If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom!   Where you goin'? I'm goin' too Where you goin'? I wanna ride with you Where you goin'? 'Cause I'm going too Where you goin'? I wanna ride with you   Woah hey Hey, you say that you hate it here So why don't we disappear? If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom! Just pick a spot on the map And I'll get you there and back If you want to go to the moon I'll take you there, baby Zoom!   Woo! Ha ha. Zoom!"
