Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently, you had to cry? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside? It's only half past the point of oblivion The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames Have you ever felt this way? La la la la La la la la There you are, sitting in the garden Clutching my coffee Calling me sugar You called me sugar Have you ever wished for an endless night? Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight? Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself Will it ever get better than tonight? Tonight"

And answered when wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that and someone believed it Look what it's done so far What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing? And what do we think we might see? Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me All of us under its spell, I know that they're probably magic Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices? I hear them calling my name Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same I've heard it too many times to ignore it There's something that I'm supposed to be Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me"
