She begins to laugh, which grows more maniacal as she crosses the lot to a set of stairs.  TOVE LO: Fuck this.  As Tove walks up the stairs and along the top floor, her laughing slows and turns into a short burst of rage before breaking down and sobbing. She reaches her room and enters.  The title ""Fairy Dust"" appears along with Tove Lo's name.  MUSIC CUE: FAIRY DUST (CHAPTER 1)  SCREEN TEXT: There is nothing pure about the way we do things.  LINA ESCO: Look at that. How does she even get into that dress? She thinks she looks good? I would never let that happen to me. No, I made sure to keep my figure. Not settling and marrying another fat fuck like she is. I mean, if she falls to the ground, she could easily crush a baby. But those tiny fuckers, they deserve it. I, I can't stand those screaming, tiny lumps. Luckily, I never had any. Why ruin the best years of your life trying to raise an ungrateful little bitch or a fucking rapist? I don't want that kind of guilt on my shoulders. Hmm. Those are cute bridesmaid dresses. They never really make cute bridesmaid dresses anymore. It's almost like the bride made sure her friends wouldn't outshine her, so she made them look plain ugly. And they already hate her for, for getting married. And now, 10 years later, she comes home and finds her husband in bed with the maid of honor.  TOVE LO: It's always the fucking maid of honor.  LINA ESCO: Mmhmm. People are afraid of being alone. Not me. I like it. I like it. I'm independent. I live my life to the fullest. Oh my god, look at her fucking husband crying like a little bitch! Does she really think that fat fuck is going to be strong for her when she needs him? Be a man! What a joke. ""I'm a feminist, but I still want you to call me a whore and cum all over my face."" That stands for fucking virginity. Purity, you know? There's nothing pure about the way we do things. There never was. We're humans. We're dirty. Thank God I have ways to numb the pain. You want some?  MUSIC CUE: INFLUENCE  TOVE LO: Why is it not working anymore? It used to be enough, as long as it was all the time. It's a never-ending escape. I don't even have any real problems. It's all just anxiety over shit that you decided I should want to need, but don't have. You think we're playing the same game. Fuck you. I don't care. I'm falling right back into my dark hole and I've never felt more safe. No one expects anything from me here. I'm free.  MUSIC CUE: LADY WOOD  [Vocals from ""True Disaster,"" Verse 2] Pretty girls, they like it fancy, but you don't keep it clean We get dirty and we go hard, some things we don't mean  LINA ESCO: The first time we met, do you remember? You, you, you were so in love with this older guy and you couldn't get him out of your head. And then he left and he pretended he never knew you. And it was just you, me, and summertime. All the crazy shit that we did. Do you remember graduation, junior high, when we almost drove into that fucking ditch? Passed out, pants down, with no fucking idea where we were? That taxi driver that didn't know what to do with us. He was like, ""Fucking, what the fuck is wrong with these girls?"" I guess you say if you're not careful, you could die. But what's the point, right? We're all gonna die anyway. We're all gonna fucking die.  MUSIC CUE: TRUE DISASTER  TOVE LO: Where did the pain come from when everything's so shiny and beautiful?  SCREEN TEXT: I wanna be free like you.  MUSIC CUE: COOL GIRL  TOVE LO: It's better this way. Goodbye.  MUSIC CUE: VIBES  Tove and Joe walk off towards the sun as you hear Tove singing lines from ""Vibes."" Cut to the motel, second floor, where Tove is sitting against a door, visually singing the lines.   What's your line, though? That I'm fine, oh Heard that before But somehow, it means more What's your line, though? That I'm fine, oh Heard that before But somehow, it means more  TOVE LO: Fuck you.  Screen cuts to black, followed by aerial views over mountains and the city.  TOVE LO: Nobody knows me, know all the dark sides, all the things that really go on in my head when I talk to people. Sociopath, psychopath. What if he's right?  MUSIC CUE: WHAT I WANT FOR THE NIGHT (BITCHES)  TOVE LO: You like that shit?"

Or are they just looking when I look at them? I can't tell. My head and my ego are the same now. Everything is so beautiful, but so cold. Where did the fire go? I'm having a hard time, I think. I'm detached, I'm jaded, I'm getting fucking old, man. I'm an old bitch. Still wet, though! I miss being naive and excited. I think that's my natural state, actually, but someone told me long ago that you're way cooler if you don't care about anything, but still act like you've seen it all. Like everything is boring. Spoiled fuckers.  MUSIC CUE: DON'T TALK ABOUT IT  TOVE LO: You know, I'm romantic, but not the way you think. I don't want a family, I don't wanna get married or be someone's fucking wife. That's not what love is about. I wanna be with someone 'cause I want them, not 'cause I need them, you know? Ha! Bullshit, you needy bitch.  TOVE LO: I'm gonna tell you a secret. When I was 14, I fell in love with my best friend's older brother, and he fell in love with me, too. Nobody knew about it. He was my first love.  TOVE LO: He ended it after a while 'cause, I don't know, he was 19, his life was starting? I guess it was also my first heartbreak. I had no one to cry to, like, nobody. And my friend, she, she found out a few months later, and he just fully denied it. He said I was delusional, he called me a crazy stalker, all that bullshit. And you know, rumors started flying around, and people believed him. I honestly didn't care what they were saying or what they were thinking about me. I just, I was really hurt that, even to me, he wouldn't admit that he had loved me. I sound like a victim now, but it was really pretty exciting.

Where did the fire go? I'm detached, I'm jaded, I'm getting fucking old, man. I'm an old bitch. Still wet, though! I miss being naive and excited. Someone told me long ago that you're way cooler if you don't care about anything, but still act like you've seen it all. Like everything is boring. Spoiled fuckers. We're the worst."
