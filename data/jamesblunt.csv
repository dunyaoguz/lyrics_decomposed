Are there silver shores on paradise? Can I come in from the cold? I killed a man in a far away land My enemy I'm told   I really want you to really want me But I really don't know if you can do that I know you want to know what's right But I know it's so hard for you to do that And time's running out as often it does And often dictates that you can't do that But fate can't break this feeling inside That's burning up through my veins I really want you I really want you I really want you now No matter what I say or do The message isn't getting through And you're listening to the sound Of my breaking heart I really want you I really want you   Is a poor man rich in solitude? Or will mother earth complain Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but Lady luck for rain They say a million people bow and scrape To an effigy of gold I saw life begin And the ship we're in And history unfold

For so long I admit that for a know it all I've been wrong. So wrong I've worn so many faces All the colours I've been when I'm with you I wish I could switch places With the one that you give your heart to  I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now  I've been waiting for a miracle Since I was young, since I was young What I had I didn't recognise 'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone  I've worn so many faces All the colours I've been when I'm with you I wish I could switch places With the one that you give your heart to  I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now  I've worn so many faces All the colours I've been when I'm with you I've tried to fill the spaces All the pieces still don't add up to you  I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now  I'm still working it out What I'm doing without you I'm lost that's what I've found I'm hopeless and I need you now Had my head in the clouds My dreams watered down It's not until you're not around That I know that I need you now  I'm still working it out I'm still working it out I'm still working it out I'm still working it out I'm still working it out"
