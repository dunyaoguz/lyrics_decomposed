Have to make a decision Why not stay and be caught? Should I give that a thought What could be his response?  But then what if he knew Who I am when I know That I'm not what he thinks That he wants?  Or, then, what if I am? What a Prince would envision? But then how can you know Who you are till you know What you want, which I don't? So then which do you pick:  Where you're safe, out of sight And yourself, but where everything's wrong? Or where everything's right But you know that you'll never belong? And whichever you pick Do it quick 'Cause you're starting to stick To the steps of the palace  It's my first big decision The choice isn't easy to make To arrive at a ball Is exciting and all Once you're there, though, it's scary And it's fun to deceive When you know you can leave But you have to be wary There's a lot that's at stake But I've stalled long enough 'Cause I'm still standing stuck In the stuff on these steps  Better run along home And avoid the collision Though at home they don't care I'll be better off there Where there's nothing to choose So there's nothing to lose So I'll pry up my shoes  Wait, though, thinking it through Things don't have to collide I know what my decision is Which is not to decide I'll just leave him a clue: For example, a shoe And then see what he'll do Now it's he and not you Who'll be stuck with a shoe In a stew, in the goo And I've learned something, too Something I never knew On the steps of the palace"

Holla-Day! Poppy break it down The first holiday we're presenting to you A sparkly shiny day called glitterpalooza Homie guy diamond take the mic And give the Bergens something they gon' like!  When you wake up in the morning Whether it's sunny or whether it's stormy Open the door for a big surprise A blast of glitter shoots in your eyes Glitterpalooza Glitterpalooza Glitterpalooza  Oh yeah oh that got in there ughh oh it's bad  Maybe the holidays not really cool for us  I don't think they celebrate that way That's okay we got tons of holidays Biggie, tell em about tickle day!  We celebrate with giggles Get tickled Get tickled Get tickled By spiders! Tickle day!  Ugh! Ahhhhhh!!!!  Huh, clearly not your idea of fun Yo Satin, Chenille, show them another one  Everyone will scream hooray In the electric foam parade We got laces that sparkle and glow So everyone enjoys the show And the foam shooting bubbles in the air You'll be blinding by the lights but you just won't care Flip a little switch get a bubble bum bum 'Cause a party ain't a party without laces and foam Laces and foam Laces and foam Laces and foam Foam and laces  Ahhh it stings! These don't seem like Bergen things! What?!  Ugh! Okay not the holiday for you It's all good we're only halfway through You've gotta be kidding me? All your family and friends will gather round To enjoy the majestic sound A chorus you will hear from miles away For 24 hours its balloon squeal day! Hahahahaha I like that sound  Eh Poppy, this whole thing has been great Thank you And you're great for doing it Thank you again But it's a disaster Thank y- wait what? You know that wise old saying ‘""Go big or go home""? Maybe we should go- Bigger! Okay that's not what I meant"
