So shout out to the mc's and the divas and the singers and the prom queens And the folks who don't ever get invited to the party But somehow be the first on the scene To the folks who just wanna be free Took all that age you too young you can't see Ask them when was the last time they had a dream Cause every river leads to the sea, to the sea    Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires Casting your fears away, as it flows above the skies, the skies Where your worries will drown out You imagine how it would be right now Casting your fears away as it flows above the skies, the skies Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river Hope is a river, of dreams afraid to be real, real, real, to be real    He yo world, and I pray for the good days, for the world to be a better place Cause I know one day will be a better way, everyone could have a getaway When we go into a place where there's love in ours now, ours now, ours now And I know that one day will be a way from the gun play Cause somehow all the pain got a sudden change Take away all the pain and the hate to this love now The world is a big danger, we're leaving right now    Hope is a river that runs random, a stream of floating desires Casting your fears away, as it flows above the skies, the skies Where your worries will drown out You imagine how it would be right now Casting your fears away as it flows above the skies, the skies Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river Hope is a river, hope is a river, hope is a river Hope is a river, of dreams afraid to be real, real, real, to be real"
