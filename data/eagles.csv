What have you done to be losing the one You held it so tight in your hand well Time passes and you must move on Half the distance takes you twice as long So you keep on singing for the sake of the song After the thrill is gone After the thrill is gone   You're afraid you might fall out of fashion And you're feeling cold and small Any kind of love without passion That ain't no kind of loving at all, well   Same dances in the same old shoes You get too careful with the steps you choose You don't care about winning but you don't want to lose After the thrill is gone After the thrill is gone After the thrill is gone, oh After the thrill is gone"

I'm not counting on tomorrow And I can't tell wrong from right But I'd give anything to be there in your arms tonight   Weaving down the American highway Through the litter and the wreckage and the cultural junk Bloated with entitlement, loaded on propaganda And now we're driving dazed and drunk Been down the road to Damascus The road to Mandalay Met the ghost of Caesar on the Appian way He said, ""It's hard to stop this binging, once you get a taste"" ""But the road to empire is a bloody stupid waste""   Behold the bitten apple, the power of the tools But all the knowledge in the world is of no use to fools   And it's a long road out of Eden"

Like you're rolling so fast that you're spinning your wheels? Don't feel too bad, you're not all along We're all trying to get along With everybody else trying to go their way You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say? Just go along until they turn out the lights There's nothing we can do to fight it   No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain And we who must remain go on living just the same   I once knew a man, very talented guy He's sing for the people and people would cry They knew that his song came from deep down inside You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind Called him home     We who must remain go on laughing just the same"
