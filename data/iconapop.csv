Think that you can change it? Top, top, top, top rated   Now there's no walking round it, your attitude Keep barking at the top but I'm an underdog I'm quitting sick and tired, no crown in your empire DIY pedestals are just what makes me Slip and slide and see my color fade Come a time when I can put no more in I try to do right until my heart breaks In need of repair, it won't be you I'm calling   Try take me down, I'll be right up 'Cause you aim too low and I've had enough   Always been top rated You think you can change it? Think that you can change it? Top, top, top, top rated   Try take me down, I'll be right up 'Cause you aim too low and I've had enough   Always been top rated You think you can change it? Think that you can change it? Top, top, top, top rated"
