People want to feel like they will surely Do everything before they die that they dream of But deep down maybe we all know it may not happen Since you can die at any minute We know for sure it would not be desirable to die Without someone holding your hand Dying with someone holding your hand is more valuable Than going for a skydive, I think It’s all perspective. All relative All said and done, wanting someone and not pursuing it Is one of life’s great tortures We are mammals after all A first kiss with that special someone Should never be at the bottom of anyone’s bucket list Because life is simply too short And before you know it, you run out of time   Climb a mountain, swim the seven seas Get your body to look like Hercules Jump out an airplane with a parachute Fly up and away on a hot air balloon   We don’t know where it all ends Some say it’s almost over, almost over If this is it then baby why aren’t I on your shoulder? On your shoulder...   In this lifetime I want you to be mine Cause I took a long look at my bucket list And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and Whoa, I’m running out of time Whoa, I’m running out of time   Get on your boots and visit the North Pole Try every sport until you score a goal Follow the path of a butterfly Go to Ground Zero and do nothing but cry   We don't know how much time left we got left in this world This beautiful world   In this lifetime I want you to be mine Cause I took a long look at my bucket list And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and Whoa, I’m running out of time Whoa, I’m running out of time   And, this is not a dare Not some trick of a daredevil I’d trade in my wildest dreams For your forever   In this lifetime I want you to be mine Cause I took a long look at my bucket list And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and Cause I took a long look at my bucket list And I saw that at the bottom it said our first kiss and Whoa I’m running out of time Whoa I’m running out of time Whoa I’m running out of time Whoa I’m running out of time   To make you mine (to make you mine) To make you mine (to make you mine) To make you mine (mine) To make you mine (to make you mine, make you mine)"
