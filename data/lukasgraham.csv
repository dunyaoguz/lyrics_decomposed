I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major I got my boys with me at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later   Once I was 20 years old, my story got told I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me Once I was 20 years old Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon we'll be 30 years old   I'm still learning about life My woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs And I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me Some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind My brother I'm still sorry   Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61 Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month   Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me Soon I'll be 60 years old Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me Soon I'll be 60 years old   Once I was seven years old, my momma told me Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old  Once I was seven years old"

They'll say, you have a burden to carry Somewhere along the line, there's a girl to marry But don't worry, I'll get up I won't give it up even if it won't stop Hurting in my heart now that we're apart My chronic pain is about to start, will it be hard? I'd rather live one day as a lion Than live a hundred years as a sheep I'd rather reign in hell than serve in heaven Live my dreams out in reality and not in my sleep   We're past the past The now is now The future will be here in a minute But I don't care what's going down 'Cause we're past the past The now is now The future will be here in a minute But I don't care what's going down, anyhow"

And childish to think that love  Gives life a higher meaning?

You'll never know the person I'll be You're not there With me...   Though I know that you're not there I still write you all these songs It's like, you got the right to know what's going on As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound At times I still think I can spot you in the crowd   Every step I take, you used to lead the way Now I'm terrified to face it on my own   You're not there To celebrate the man that you made You're not there To share in my success and mistakes Is it fair? You'll never know the person I'll be You're not there With me...   Time can heal your wounds if You're strong and standing tall I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all They say ""You'll grow older, and it'll get better still"" Yes, I will, but no it won't They don't get it, cause...   You're not there To celebrate the man that you made You're not there To share in my success and mistakes Is it fair? You'll never know the person I'll be You're not there With me..."
