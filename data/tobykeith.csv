The traffic’s always heavy And the air ain’t fit to breathe I ain’t saying that it’s wrong for you It just don’t make sense to me

""What you gonna do when you get there? ""Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea? ""Oh, you're never gonna find ""Someone who loves you like I do ""If you get tired of running ""You can turn around and walk back to me.""   He called up to tell her he missed her a lot Texas Panhandle was as far as he got He'd run out money, he'd run of luck He'd run out of gas in his pick-up truck ""Hitch a ride, catch a train or a Greyhound bus ""'Cause there's a baby on the way and that makes three of us ""And I need you here beside me, I can't go it alone,"" She told him one more time then she hung up the 'phone   Saying, ""Where you gonna go? ""What you gonna do when you get there? ""Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea? ""You know, you're never gonna find ""Someone who loves you like I do ""When you get tired of running ""You can turn around and walk back to me.""   And the years just seemed to roll on by them She missed him more and more every day And that boy grew up to look and act just like him And she knew some day soon he'd be old enough to fly away   And she'd say: ""Baby, where you gonna go? ""What you gonna do when you get there? ""Who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea? ""You know, you're never gonna find ""Someone who loves you like I do ""When you get tired of running ""You can turn around and walk back to me.""   ""If you ever get tired of running ""Turn around and walk back to me."""
